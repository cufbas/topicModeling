"Machine learning has achieved considerable successes in recent years and an ever-growing number of disciplines rely on it. However, this success crucially relies on human machine learning experts, who select appropriate features, workflows, machine learning paradigms, algorithms, and their hyperparameters. As the complexity of these tasks is often beyond non-experts, the rapid growth of machine learning applications has created a demand for off-the-shelf machine learning methods that can be used easily and without expert knowledge. We call the resulting research area that targets progressive automation of machine learning AutoML.

"In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized machine learning. Most successful applications of deep learning involve predicting single variables (e.g., univariate regression or multi-class classification). However, many real problems involve highly dependent, structured variables. In such scenarios, it is desired or even necessary to model correlations and dependencies between the multiple input and output variables. Such problems arise in a wide range of domains, from natural language processing, computer vision, computational biology and others. Some approaches to these problems directly use deep learning concepts, such as those that generate sequences using recurrent neural networks or that output image segmentations through convolutions. Others adapt the concepts from structured output learning. These structured output prediction problems were traditionally handled using linear models and hand-crafted features, with a structured optimization such as inference. It has recently been proposed to combine the representational power of deep neural networks with modeling variable dependence in a structured prediction framework. There are numerous interesting research questions related to modeling and optimization that arise in this problem space.This workshop will bring together experts in machine learning and application domains whose research focuses on combining deep learning and structured models. Specifically, we aim to provide an overview of existing approaches from various domains to distill from their success principles that can be more generally applicable. We will also discuss the main challenges that arise in this setting and outline potential directions for future progress. The target audience consists of researchers and practitioners in machine learning and application areas.

"For details see:http://machlearn.gitlab.io/hitl2017/As machine learning systems become more ubiquitous in everybody’s day-to-day life or work, society and industry is in an intermediate state between fully manual and fully automatic systems. The gradient undoubtedly points towards full automation, but moving forward in this direction is going to face increasing challenges due to the fact that current machine learning research tends to focus on end to end systems, which puts aside the fact that for practical applications there are still gaps or caveats in the automation. Parts of these come from the presence of (or the necessity to have) the Human in the Loop.There are two main locations for the Human in the automated system: (i) upstream, in which case the focus is mainly  in the inputs of the algorithm. This can be essential for personalised assistants, that describe environments where the machine learning method is tightly embedded into the system. Such environments pose additional challenges related  to privacy at large; (ii) downstream: other domains have machine learning approaches analyse parts of the data, and human experts use the results and intuition to make decisions. The Human dependences between these two locations is also neither straightforward nor acyclic — some applications tend  to have feedback effects on data as actions or interventions are undertaken based on machine learning predictions. Furthermore there are often very few rounds of decision making in practice, but each round may affect the statement of the problems related to the Human presence, as witnessed for example by eventual privacy leakages.This workshop aims to bring together people who are working on systems where machine learning is only part of the solution. Participants will exchange ideas and experiences on human in the loop machine learning.Topics of interest include:- System architectures that allow for human decision making- User interfaces for interacting with machine learning systems- Validation of human in the loop software systems- Viewpoints from traditional fields such as reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimisation- Challenges related to the human presence in the loop (privacy, bias, fairness, etc.)- Case studies of deployed machine learning

"Although dramatic progress has been made in the field of autonomous driving, there are many major challenges in achieving full-autonomy. For example, how to make perception accurate and robust to accomplish safe autonomous driving? How to reliably track cars, pedestrians, and cyclists? How to learn long term driving strategies (known as driving policies) so that autonomous vehicles can be equipped with adaptive human negotiation skills when merging, overtaking and giving way, etc? How to achieve near-zero fatality?These complex challenges associated with autonomy in physical world naturally suggest that we take a machine learning approach. Deep learning and computer vision have found many real-world applications such as face tagging. However, perception for autonomous driving has a unique set of requirements such as safety and explainability. Autonomous vehicles need to choose actions, e.g. steering commands which will affect the subsequent inputs (driving scenes) encountered. This setting is well-suited to apply reinforcement learning to determine the best actions to take. Many autonomous driving tasks such as perception and tracking requires large data sets of labeled examples to learn rich and high-performance visual representation. However, the progress is hampered by the sheer expenses of human labelling needed. Naturally we would like to employ unsupervised learning, transfer learning leveraging simulators, and techniques can learn efficiently.The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from in the field of autonomous driving to address core challenges with machine learning. These challenges include, but are not limited toaccurate and efficient pedestrian detection, pedestrian intent detection,machine learning for object tracking,unsupervised representation learning for autonomous driving,deep reinforcement learning for learning driving policies,cross-modal and simulator to real-world transfer learning, scene classification, real-time perception and prediction of traffic scenes,uncertainty propagation in deep neural networks,efficient inference with deep neural networksThe workshop will include invited speakers, panels, presentations of accepted papers and posters. We invite papers in the form of short, long and position papers to address the core challenges mentioned above. We encourage researchers and practitioners on self-driving cars, transportation systems and ride-sharing platforms to participate. Since this is a topic of broad and current interest, we expect at least 200 participants from leading university researchers, auto-companies and ride-sharing companies.

"Probabilistic models are a central implement in machine learning practice. They form the basis for models that generate realistic data, uncover hidden structure, and make predictions. Traditionally, probabilistic models in machine learning have focused on prescribed models. Prescribed models specify a joint density over observed and hidden variables that can be easily evaluated. The requirement of a tractable density simplifies their learning but limits their flexibility --- several real world phenomena are better described by simulators that do not admit a tractable density. Probabilistic models defined only via the simulations they produce are called implicit models.Arguably starting with generative adversarial networks, research on implicit models in machine learning has exploded in recent years. This workshop’s aim is to foster a discussion around the recent developments and future directions of implicit models.Implicit models have many applications. They are used in ecology where models simulate animal populations over time; they are used in phylogeny, where simulations produce hypothetical ancestry trees; they are used in physics to generate particle simulations for high energy processes. Recently, implicit models have been used to improve the state-of-the-art in image and content generation. Part of the workshop’s focus is to discuss the commonalities among applications of implicit models.Of particular interest at this workshop is to unite fields that work on implicit models. For example:+ Generative adversarial networks (a NIPS 2016 workshop) are implicit models with an adversarial training scheme.+ Recent advances in variational inference (a NIPS 2015 and 2016 workshop) have leveraged implicit models for more accurate approximations.+ Approximate Bayesian computation (a NIPS 2015 workshop) focuses on posterior inference for models with implicit likelihoods.+ Learning implicit models is deeply connected to two sample testing and density ratio estimation.We hope to bring together these different views on implicit models, identifying their core challenges and combining their innovations.We invite submission of 4 page papers for posters, contributed talks, and travel awards. Topics of interests are: implicit models, approximate Bayesian computation, generative adversarial networks, learning and inference for implicit models, implicit variational approximations, evaluation of implicit models and two sample testing. We encourage both theoretical and applied submissions.

"Retrieval techniques operating on text or semantic annotations have become the industry standard for retrieval from large document collections. However, traditional information retrieval techniques operate on the assumption that the user issues a single query and the system responds with a ranked list of documents. In recent years we have witnessed a substantial growth in text data coming from various online resources, such as online newspapers, blogs, specialised document collections (e.g. arXiv). Traditional information retrieval approaches often fail to provide users with adequate support when browsing such online resources, hence in recent years there has been a growing interest in developing new algorithms and design methods that can support interactive information retrieval. The aim of this workshop is to explore new methods and related system design for interactive data analytics and management in various domains, including specialised text collections (e.g. legal, medical, scientific) as well as for various tasks, such as semantic information retrieval, conceptual organization and clustering of data collections for sense making, semantic expert profiling, and document recommender systems.Of interest, also, is probabilistic and machine learning formulations of the interactive information retrieval task above and beyond the simple ""stochastic language models"" framework developed in the information retrieval community.The primary audience of the workshop are researchers and practitioners in the area of interactive and personalised system design as well as interactive machine learning both from academia and industry.

"One of the most challenging and open problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is that of Lifelong Learning:​“Lifelong Learning is the continued learning of tasks, from one or more domains, over the course of a lifetime, by a lifelong learning system. A lifelong learning system efficiently and effectively (1) retains the knowledge it has learned; (2) selectively transfers knowledge to learn new tasks; and (3) ensures the effective and efficient interaction between (1) and (2).”Lifelong learning is still in its infancy. Many issues currently exist such as learning general representations, catastrophic forgetting, efficient knowledge retention mechanisms and hierarchical abstractions.  Much work has been done in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) community to tackle different elements of lifelong learning. Active research topics include hierarchical abstractions, transfer learning, multi-task learning and curriculum learning. With the emergence of powerful function approximators such as in Deep Learning, we feel that now is a perfect time to provide a forum to discuss ways to move forward and provide a truly general lifelong learning framework, using RL-based algorithms, with more rigour than ever before. This workshop will endeavour to promote interaction between researchers working on the different elements of lifelong learning to try and find a synergy between the various techniques.

"The ever-increasing size and accessibility of vast music libraries has created a demand more than ever for machine learning systems that are capable of understanding and organizing this complex data.  While this topic has received relatively little attention within the machine learning community, it has been an area of intense focus within the community of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), where significant progress has been made, but these problems remain far from solved.Furthermore, the recommender systems community has made great progress in terms of collaborative feedback recommenders, but these approaches suffer strongly from the cold-start problem.  As such, recommendation techniques often fall back on content-based machine learning systems, but defining musical similarity is extremely challenging as myriad features all play some role (e.g., cultural, emotional, timbral, rhythmic).We seek to use this workshop to bring together a group of world-class experts to discuss these challenges and share them with the greater machine learning community.  In addition to making progress on these challenges, we hope to engage the machine learning community with our nebulous problem space, and connect them with the many available datasets the MIR community has to offer (e.g., AcousticBrainz, Million Song Dataset), which offer near commercial scale to the academic research community.

"We routinely encounter scenarios where at test-time we must predict on a budget. Feature costs in Internet, Healthcare, and Surveillance applications arise due to feature extraction time and feature/sensor acquisition~\cite{trapeznikov:2013b} costs. Data analytics applications in mobile devices are often performed on remote cloud services due to the limited device capabilities, which imposes memory/prediction time costs. Naturally, in these settings, one needs to carefully understand the trade-off between accuracy and prediction cost. Uncertainty in the observations, which is typical in such scenarios, further adds to complexity of the task and requires a careful understanding of both the uncertainty as well as accuracy-cost tradeoffs. In this workshop, we aim to bring together researchers from various domains to discuss the key aspects of the above mentioned emerging and critical topic. The goal is to provide a platform where ML/statistics/optimization researchers can interact closely with domain experts who need to deploy ML models in resource-constrained settings (like an IoT device maker), and chart out the foundational problems in the area and key tools that can be used to solve them. Motivation===================Prediction under budget constraints is a critical problem that arise in several settings like medical diagnosis, search engines and surveillance. In these applications, budget constraints arise as a result of limits on computational cost, time, network-throughput and power-consumption. For instance, in search engines CPU cost during prediction-time must be budgeted to enable business models such as online advertising. Additionally, search engines have time constraints at prediction-time as users are known to abandon the service is the response time of the search engine is not within a few tens of milliseconds. In another example, modern passenger screening systems impose constraints on throughput. An extreme version of these problems appear in the Internet of Things (IoT) setting where one requires prediction on tiny IoT devices which might have at most 2KB of RAM and no floating point computation unit. IoT is considered to be the next multi-billion industry with “smart” devices being designed for production-line, cars, retail stores, and even for toothbrush and spoons. Given that IoT based solutions seem destined to significantly permeate our day-to-day lives,  ML based predictions on the device become critical due to several reasons like privacy, battery, latency etc.  Learning under resource constraints departs from the traditional machine learning setting and introduces new exciting challenges. For instance, features are accompanied by costs (e.g. extraction time in search engines or true monetary values in medical diagnosis) and their amortized sum is constrained at test-time. Also, different search strategies in prediction can have widely varying computational costs (e.g., binary search, linear search, dynamic programming). In other settings, a system must maintain a throughput constraint to keep pace with arriving traffic.In IoT setting, the model itself has to be deployed on a 2-16KB RAM, posing an extremely challenging constraint on the algorithm. The common aspect of all of these settings is that we must seeks trade-offs between prediction accuracy and prediction cost. Studying this tradeoff is an inherent challenge that needs to be investigated in a principled fashion in order to invent practically relevant machine learning algorithms. This problems lies at the intersection of ML, statistics, stochastic control and information theory. We aim to draw researchers working on foundational, algorithmic and application problems within these areas. We plan on organizing a demo session which would showcase ML algorithms running live on various resource-constrained device, demonstrating their effectiveness on challenging real-world tasks. In addition, we plan to invite Ofer Dekel from Microsoft Research to present a new platform for deploying ML on tiny devices which should provide a easy way to deploy and compare various ML techniques on realistic devices and further spur multiple research directions in this area.

"Picky Learners consists of a broad range of learning scenarios where the learner does not simply process every data point blindly, but instead can choose to incorporate them in alternative ways. Despite the growing costs of processing and labelling vast amounts of data, only isolated efforts have tackled this problem primarily in the areas of active learning, learning with rejection and on-line learning with feedback graphs.  In active learning, the learner can choose whether or not to query for a label of each data point, thereby paying different costs for each data point.  A key advantage in this setting is that the number of examples queried to learn a concept may be much smaller than the number of examples needed in standard supervised learning. More recently, some have used variations of confidence-based models to determine which labels to query.  Confidence-based models lie under the more general framework of learning with rejection, which is a key learning scenario where the algorithm can abstain from making a prediction, at the price of incurring a fixed cost. In this scenario, our picky learners can thus choose to abstain from providing a label. In the on-line setting, one can cast learning with rejection under the more general topic of on-line learning with feedback graphs, a setting that interpolates between bandit and full expert scenario in that the player observes a variety of different expert losses after choosing an action. On-line learning with feedback graphs can then in turn be connected back to active learning where depending on the feedback graph only certain labels are requested.In short, our picky learners can choose to query for the label (active learning), choose to abstain on the label (learning with rejection) or choose to receive different expert losses (on-line learning with feedback graphs). All of three of these fields attempt in different ways to reduce the cost of processing the data by allowing for picky learners, but the connections between these topics has not been fully explored in terms of both theory and practice. The goal of this workshop is then to bring together researchers and practitioners in these three areas in order to bridge the gap between active learning, learning with rejection, and on-line learning with feedback graphs. We expect that the fruitful collaborations started in this workshop will result in novel research that will help develop each field.

"The recent advancements in deep learning have revolutionized the field of machine learning, enabling unparalleled performance and many new real-world applications. Yet, the developments that led to this success have often been driven by empirical studies, and little is known about the theory behind some of the most successful approaches. While theoretically well-founded deep learning architectures had been proposed in the past, they came at a price of increased complexity and reduced tractability. Recently, we have witnessed considerable interest in principled deep learning. This led to a better theoretical understanding of existing architectures as well as development of more mature deep models with solid theoretical foundations. In this workshop, we intend to review the state of those developments and provide a platform for the exchange of ideas between the theoreticians and the practitioners of the growing deep learning community.

"This workshop focuses on issues of reproducibility and replication of results in the Machine Learning community. Papers from the Machine Learning community are supposed to be a valuable asset. They can help to inform and inspire future research. They can be a useful educational tool for students. They can give guidance to applied researchers in industry. Perhaps most importantly, they can help us to answer the most fundamental questions about our existence - what does it mean to learn and what does it mean to be human? Reproducibility, while not always possible in science (consider the study of a transient astrological phenomenon like a passing comet), is a powerful criteria for improving the quality of research. A result which is reproducible is more likely to be robust and meaningful and rules out many types of experimenter error (either fraud or accidental).There are many interesting open questions about how reproducibility issues intersect with the Machine Learning community:* How can we tell if papers in the Machine Learning community are reproducible even in theory? If a paper is about recommending news sites before a particular election, and the results come from running the system online in production - it will be impossible to reproduce the published results because the state of the world is irreversibly changed from when the experiment was ran.* What does it mean for a paper to be reproducible in theory but not in practice? For example, if a paper requires tens of thousands of GPUs to reproduce or a large closed-off dataset, then it can only be reproduced in reality by a few  large labs.* For papers which are reproducible both in theory and in practice - how can we ensure that papers published in ICML would actually be able to replicate if such an experiment were attempted?* What does it mean for a paper to have successful or unsuccessful replications?* Of the papers with attempted replications completed, how many have been published?* What can be done to ensure that as many papers which are reproducible in theory fall into the last category?* On the reproducibility issue, what can the Machine Learning community learn from other fields?Our aim in the following workshop is to raise the profile of these questions in the community and to search for their answers. In doing so we aim for papers focusing on the following topics:* Analysis of the current state of reproducibility in machine learning venues* Tools to help increase reproducibility* Evidence that reproducibility is important for science* Connections between the reproducibility situation in Machine Learning and other fields* Replications, both failed and successful, of influential papers in the Machine Learning literature.

"Time series data is ubiquitous. In domains as diverse as finance, entertainment, transportation and health-care, we observe a fundamental shift away from parsimonious, infrequent measurement to nearly continuous monitoring and recording. Rapid advances in diverse sensing technologies, ranging from remote sensors to wearables and social sensing, are generating a rapid growth in the size and complexity of time series archives. Thus, although time series analysis has been studied extensively, its importance only continues to grow. Furthermore, modern time series data pose significant challenges to existing techniques both in terms of the structure (e.g., irregular sampling in hospital records and spatiotemporal structure in climate data) and size. These challenges are compounded by the fact that standard i.i.d. assumptions used in other areas of machine learning are not appropriate for time series and new theory, models and algorithms are needed to process and analyse this data.The goal of this workshop is to bring together theoretical and applied researchers interested in the analysis of time series and development of new algorithms to process sequential data.

"This workshop will bring together researchers who study the interpretability of predictive models, develop interpretable machine learning algorithms, and develop methodology to interpret black-box machine learning models (e.g., post-hoc interpretations).  This is a very exciting time to study interpretable machine learning, as the advances in large-scale optimization and Bayesian inference that have enabled the rise of black-box machine learning are now also starting to be exploited to develop principled approaches to large-scale interpretable machine learning. Participants in the workshop will exchange ideas on these and allied topics, including:●    Quantifying and axiomatizing interpretability●  Psychology of human concept learning●   Rule learning,Symbolic regression and case-based reasoning● Generalized additive models, sparsity and interpretability● Visual analytics●   Interpretable unsupervised models (clustering, topic models, e.t.c)●    Interpretation of black-box models (including deep neural networks)●    Causality of predictive models● Verifying, diagnosing and debugging machine learning systems●   Interpretability in reinforcement learning.Doctors, judges, business executives, and many other people are faced with making critical decisions that can have profound consequences. For example, doctors decide which treatment to administer to patients, judges decide on prison sentences for convicts, and business executives decide to enter new markets and acquire other companies. Such decisions are increasingly being supported by predictive models learned by algorithms from historical data.The latest trend in machine learning is to use highly nonlinear complex systems such as deep neural networks, kernel methods, and large ensembles of diverse classifiers. While such approaches often produce impressive, state-of-the art prediction accuracies, their black-box nature offers little comfort to decision makers. Therefore, in order for predictions to be adopted, trusted, and safely used by decision makers in mission-critical applications, it is imperative to develop machine learning methods that produce interpretable models with excellent predictive accuracy.  It is in this way that machine learning methods can have impact on consequential real-world applications.

"Deep networks have had profound impact across machine learning research and in many application areas. DNNs are complex to design and train. They are non-linear systems that almost always have many local optima and are often sensitive to training parameter settings and initial state. Systematic optimization of structure and hyperparameters is possible e.g. with Bayesian optimization, but hampered by the expense of training each design on realistic datasets. Exploration is still ongoing for best design principles. We argue that visualization can play an essential role in understanding DNNs and in developing new design principles. With rich tools for visual exploration of networks during training and inference, one should be able to form closer ties between theory and practice: validating expected behaviors, and exposing the unexpected which can lead to new insights. With the rise of generative modeling and reinforcement learning, more interesting directions like understanding and visualization of generative models, visual explanation for driving policy could be explored as well. As the second edition of this workshop, we are proposing changes based on the lessons we learned last year. We would like to organize a few domain specific tutorials, and panel discussions.

Abstract
This workshop builds on our AI for Social Good workshop at NeurIPS 2018 and ICLR 2019.
Introduction: The rapid expansion of AI research presents two clear conundrums:

the comparative lack of incentives for researchers to address social impact issues and
the dearth of conferences and journals centered around the topic. Researchers motivated to help often find themselves without a clear idea of which fields to delve into.

Goals: Our workshop address both these issues by bringing together machine learning researchers, social impact leaders, stakeholders, policy leaders, and philanthropists to discuss their ideas and applications for social good. To broaden the impact beyond the convening of our workshop, we are partnering with AI Commons to expose accepted projects and papers to the broader community of machine learning researchers and engineers. The projects/research may be at varying degrees of development, from formulation as a data problem to detailed requirements for effective deployment. We hope that this gathering of talent and information will inspire the creation of new approaches and tools by the community, help scientists access the data they need, involve social and policy stakeholders in the framing of machine learning applications, and attract interest from philanthropists invited to the event to make a dent in our shared goals.
Topics: The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of seventeen objectives whose completion is set to lead to a more equitable, prosperous, and sustainable world. In this light, our main areas of focus are the following: health, education, the protection of democracy, urban planning, assistive technology, agriculture, environmental protection and sustainability, social welfare and justice, developing world. Each of these themes presents unique opportunities for AI to reduce human suffering and allow citizens and democratic institutions to thrive.
Across these topics, we have dual goals: recognizing high-quality work in machine learning motivated by or applied to social applications, and creating meaningful connections between communities dedicated to solving technical and social problems. To this extent, we propose two research tracks:

Short Papers Track (Up to four page papers + unlimited pages for citations) for oral and/or poster presentation. The short papers should focus on past and current research work, showcasing actual results and demonstrating beneficial effects on society. We also accept short papers of recently published or submitted journal contributions to give authors the opportunity to present their work and obtain feedback from conference attendees.
Problem Introduction Track (Application form, up to five page responses + unlimited pages for citations) which will present a specific solution that will be shared with stakeholders, scientists, and funders. The workshop will provide a suite of questions designed to: (1) estimate the feasibility and impact of the proposed solutions, and (2) estimate the importance of data in their implementation. The application responses should highlight ideas that have not yet been implemented in practice but can lead to real impact. The projects may be at varying degrees of development, from formulation as a data problem to structure for effective deployment. The workshop provides a supportive platform for developing these early-stage or hobby proposals into real projects. This process is designed to foster sharing different points of view ranging from the scientific assessment of feasibility, discussion of practical constraints that may be encountered, and attracting interest from philanthropists invited to the event. Accepted submissions may be promoted to the wider AI solutions community following the workshop via the AI Commons, with whom we are partnering to promote the longer-term development of projects.

"Finance is a rich domain for AI and ML research. Model-driven strategies for stock trading and risk assessment models for loan approvals are quintessential financial applications that are reasonably well-understood. However, there are a number of other applications that call for attention as well. In particular, many finance domains involve ecosystems of interacting and competing agents. Consider for instance the detection of financial fraud and money-laundering. This is a challenging multi-agent learning problem, especially because the real world agents involved evolve their strategies constantly. Similarly, in algorithmic trading of stocks, commodities, etc., the actions of any given trading agent affects, and is affected by, other trading agents -- many of these agents are constantly learning in order to adapt to evolving market scenarios. Further, such trading agents operate at such a speed and scale that they must be fully autonomous. They have grown in sophistication to employ advanced ML strategies including deep learning, reinforcement learning, and transfer learning. Financial institutions have a long history of investing in technology as a differentiator and have been key drivers in advancing computing infrastructure (e.g., low-latency networking). As more financial applications employ deep learning and reinforcement learning, there is consensus now on the need for more advanced computing architectures--for training large machine learning models and simulating large multi-agent learning systems--that balance scale with the stringent privacy requirements of finance. Historically, financial firms have been highly secretive about their proprietary technology developments. But now, there is also emerging consensus on the need for (1) deeper engagement with academia to advance a shared knowledge of the unique challenges faced in FinTech, and (2) more open collaboration with academic and technology partners through intellectually sophisticated fora such as this proposed workshop.

"Many in the machine learning community wish to take action on climate change, yet feel their skills are inapplicable.  This workshop aims to show that in fact the opposite is true: while no silver bullet, ML can be an invaluable tool both in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and in helping society adapt to the effects of climate change. Climate change is a complex problem, for which action takes many forms - from designing smart electrical grids to tracking deforestation in satellite imagery. Many of these actions represent high-impact opportunities for real-world change, as well as being interesting problems for ML research.

"Coding Theory For Large-scale Machine Learning
Coding theory involves the art and science of how to add redundancy to data to ensure that a desirable output is obtained at despite deviations from ideal behavior from the system components that interact with the data. Through a rich, mathematically elegant set of techniques, coding theory has come to significantly influence the design of modern data communications, compression and storage systems. The last few years have seen a rapidly growing interest in coding theory based approaches for the development of efficient machine learning algorithms towards robust, large-scale, distributed computational pipelines. 
The CodML workshop brings together researchers developing coding techniques for machine learning, as well as researchers working on systems implementations for computing, with cutting-edge presentations from both sides. The goal is to learn about non-idealities in system components as well as approaches to obtain reliable and robust learning despite these non-idealities, and identify problems of future interest.
The workshop is co-located with ICML 2019, and will be held in Long Beach, California, USA on June 14th or 15th, 2019.

"Exploration is a key component of reinforcement learning (RL). While RL has begun to solve relatively simple tasks, current algorithms cannot complete complex tasks. Our existing algorithms often endlessly dither, failing to meaningfully explore their environments in search of high-reward states. If we hope to have agents autonomously learn increasingly complex tasks, these machines must be equipped with machinery for efficient exploration. The goal of this workshop is to present and discuss exploration in RL, including deep RL, evolutionary algorithms, real-world applications, and developmental robotics. Invited speakers will share their perspectives on efficient exploration, and researchers will share recent work in spotlight presentations and poster sessions.

"Workshop website: https://sites.google.com/view/mbrl-icml2019In the recent explosion of interest in deep RL, “model-free” approaches based on Q-learning and actor-critic architectures have received the most attention due to their flexibility and ease of use. However, this generality often comes at the expense of efficiency (statistical as well as computational) and robustness. The large number of required samples and safety concerns often limit direct use of model-free RL for real-world settings.Model-based methods are expected to be more efficient. Given accurate models, trajectory optimization and Monte-Carlo planning methods can efficiently compute near-optimal actions in varied contexts. Advances in generative modeling, unsupervised, and self-supervised learning provide methods for learning models and representations that support subsequent planning and reasoning. Against this backdrop, our workshop aims to bring together researchers in generative modeling and model-based control to discuss research questions at their intersection, and to advance the state of the art in model-based RL for robotics and AI. In particular, this workshops aims to make progress on questions related to:1. How can we learn generative models efficiently? Role of data, structures, priors, and uncertainty.2. How to use generative models efficiently for planning and reasoning? Role of derivatives, sampling, hierarchies, uncertainty, counterfactual reasoning etc.3. How to harmoniously integrate model-learning and model-based decision making?4. How can we learn compositional structure and environmental constraints? Can this be leveraged for better generalization and reasoning?

"With the latest advances of deep generative models, synthesis of images and videos as well as of human voices have achieved impressive realism. In many domains, synthetic media are already difficult to distinguish from real by the human eye and ear. The potential of misuses of these technologies is seldom discussed in academic papers; instead, vocal concerns are rising from media and security organizations as well as from governments. Researchers are starting to experiment on new ways to integrate deep learning with traditional media forensics and security techniques as part of a technological solution. This workshop will bring together experts from the communities of machine learning, computer security and forensics in an attempt to highlight recent work and discuss future effort to address these challenges.

"Stein's method is a technique from probability theory for bounding the distance between probability measures using differential and difference operators. Although the method was initially designed as a technique for proving central limit theorems, it has recently caught the attention of the machine learning (ML) community and has been used for a variety of practical tasks. Recent applications include generative modeling, global non-convex optimisation, variational inference, de novo sampling, constructing powerful control variates for Monte Carlo variance reduction, and measuring the quality of (approximate) Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Stein's method has also been used to develop goodness-of-fit tests and was the foundational tool in one of the NeurIPS 2017 Best Paper awards. Although Stein's method has already had significant impact in ML, most of the applications only scratch the surface of this rich area of research in probability theory. There would be significant gains to be made by encouraging both communities to interact directly, and this inaugural workshop would be an important step in this direction. More precisely, the aims are: (i) to introduce this emerging topic to the wider ML community, (ii) to highlight the wide range of existing applications in ML, and (iii) to bring together experts in Stein's method and ML researchers to discuss and explore potential further uses of Stein's method.

"There has been growing interest in rectifying deep neural network vulnerabilities. Challenges arise when models receive samples drawn from outside the training distribution. For example, a neural network tasked with classifying handwritten digits may assign high confidence predictions to cat images. Anomalies are frequently encountered when deploying ML models in the real world. Well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates are indispensable for many machine learning applications, such as self-driving cars and medical diagnosis systems. Generalization to unseen and worst-case inputs is also essential for robustness to distributional shift. In order to have ML models reliably predict in open environment, we must deepen technical understanding in the following areas: (1) learning algorithms that are robust to changes in input data distribution (e.g., detect out-of-distribution examples); (2) mechanisms to estimate and calibrate confidence produced by neural networks and (3) methods to improve robustness to adversarial and common corruptions, and (4) key applications for uncertainty such as in artificial intelligence (e.g., computer vision, robotics, self-driving cars, medical imaging) as well as broader machine learning tasks.This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from the machine learning communities, and highlight recent work that contribute to address these challenges. Our agenda will feature contributed papers with invited speakers. Through the workshop we hope to help identify fundamentally important directions on robust and reliable deep learning, and foster future collaborations.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a general learning, predicting, and decision making paradigm. RL provides solution methods for sequential decision making problems as well as those can be transformed into sequential ones. RL connects deeply with optimization, statistics, game theory, causal inference, sequential experimentation, etc., overlaps largely with approximate dynamic programming and optimal control, and applies broadly in science, engineering and arts.RL has been making steady progress in academia recently, e.g., Atari games, AlphaGo, visuomotor policies for robots. RL has also been applied to real world scenarios like recommender systems and neural architecture search. See a recent collection about RL applications at https://medium.com/@yuxili/rl-applications-73ef685c07eb. It is desirable to have RL systems that work in the real world with real benefits. However, there are many issues for RL though, e.g. generalization, sample efficiency, and exploration vs. exploitation dilemma. Consequently, RL is far from being widely deployed. Common, critical and pressing questions for the RL community are then: Will RL have wide deployments? What are the issues? How to solve them?The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from industry and academia interested in addressing practical and/or theoretical issues in applying RL to real life scenarios, review state of the arts, clarify impactful research problems, brainstorm open challenges, share first-hand lessons and experiences from real life deployments, summarize what has worked and what has not, collect tips for people from industry looking to apply RL and RL experts interested in applying their methods to real domains, identify potential opportunities, generate new ideas for future lines of research and development, and promote awareness and collaboration. This is not ""yet another RL workshop"": it is about how to successfully apply RL to real life applications. This is a less addressed issue in the RL/ML/AI community, and calls for immediate attention for sustainable prosperity of RL research and development.

"The ever-increasing size and accessibility of vast music libraries has created a demand more than ever for artificial systems that are capable of understanding, organizing, or even generating such complex data. While this topic has received relatively marginal attention within the machine learning community, it has been an area of intense focus within the community of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). While significant progress has been made, these problems remain far from solved. Furthermore, the recommender systems community has made great advances in terms of collaborative feedback recommenders, but these approaches suffer strongly from the cold-start problem. As such, recommendation techniques often fall back on content-based machine learning systems, but defining musical similarity is extremely challenging as myriad features all play some role (e.g., cultural, emotional, timbral, rhythmic). Thus, for machines must actually understand music to achieve an expert level of music recommendation. On the other side of this problem sits the recent explosion of work in the area of machine creativity. Relevant examples are both Google Magenta and the startup Jukedeck, who seek to develop algorithms capable of composing and performing completely original (and compelling) works of music. These algorithms require a similar deep understanding of music and present challenging new problems for the machine learning and AI community at large. This workshop proposal is timely in that it will bridge these separate pockets of otherwise very related research. And in addition to making progress on the challenges above, we hope to engage the wide AI and machine learning community with our nebulous problem space, and connect them with the many available datasets the MIR community has to offer (e.g., Audio Set, AcousticBrainz, Million Song Dataset), which offer near commercial scale to the academic research community.

"Graph-structured representations are widely used as a natural and powerful way to encode information such as relations between objects or entities, interactions between online users (e.g., in social networks), 3D meshes in computer graphics, multi-agent environments, as well as molecular structures, to name a few. Learning and reasoning with graph-structured representations is gaining increasing interest in both academia and industry, due to its fundamental advantages over more traditional unstructured methods in supporting interpretability, causality, transferability, etc. Recently, there is a surge of new techniques in the context of deep learning, such as graph neural networks, for learning graph representations and performing reasoning and prediction, which have achieved impressive progress. However, it can still be a long way to go to obtain satisfactory results in long-range multi-step reasoning, scalable learning with very large graphs, flexible modeling of graphs in combination with other dimensions such as temporal variation and other modalities such as language and vision. New advances in theoretical foundations, models and algorithms, as well as empirical discoveries and applications are therefore all highly desirable.

"Invertible neural networks have been a significant thread of research in the ICML community for several years. Such transformations can offer a range of unique benefits: (1) They preserve information, allowing perfect reconstruction (up to numerical limits) and obviating the need to store hidden activations in memory for backpropagation. (2) They are often designed to track the changes in probability density that applying the transformation induces (as in normalizing flows). (3) Like autoregressive models, normalizing flows can be powerful generative models which allow exact likelihood computations; with the right architecture, they can also allow for much cheaper sampling than autoregressive models. While many researchers are aware of these topics and intrigued by several high-profile papers, few are familiar enough with the technical details to easily follow new developments and contribute. Many may also be unaware of the wide range of applications of invertible neural networks, beyond generative modelling and variational inference.

Abstract: A key challenge for deploying interactive machine learning systems in the real world is the ability for machines to understand human intent. Techniques such as imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning are popular data-driven paradigms for modeling agent intentions and controlling agent behaviors, and have been applied to domains ranging from robotics and autonomous driving to dialogue systems. Such techniques provide a practical solution to specifying objectives to machine learning systems when they are difficult to program by hand. While significant progress has been made in these areas, most research effort has concentrated on modeling and controlling single agents from dense demonstrations or feedback. However, the real world has multiple agents, and dense expert data collection can be prohibitively expensive. Surmounting these obstacles requires progress in frontiers such as: 1) the ability to infer intent from multiple modes of data, such as language or observation, in addition to traditional demonstrations. 2) the ability to model multiple agents and their intentions, both in cooperative and adversarial settings. 3) handling partial or incomplete information from the expert, such as demonstrations that lack dense action annotations, raw videos, etc.. The workshop on Imitation, Intention, and Interaction (I3) seeks contributions at the interface of these frontiers, and will bring together researchers from multiple disciplines such as robotics, imitation and reinforcement learning, cognitive science, AI safety, and natural language understanding. Our aim will be to reexamine the assumptions in standard imitation learning problem statements (e.g., inverse reinforcement learning) and connect distinct application disciplines, such as robotics and NLP, with researchers developing core imitation learning algorithms. In this way, we hope to arrive at new problem formulations, new research directions, and the development of new connections across distinct disciplines that interact with imitation learning methods.

"Time series data is both quickly growing and already ubiquitous. In domains spanning as broad a range as climate, robotics, entertainment, finance, healthcare, and transportation, there has been a significant shift away from parsimonious, infrequent measurements to nearly continuous monitoring and recording. Rapid advances in sensing technologies, ranging from remote sensors to wearables and social sensing, are generating rapid growth in the size and complexity of time series data streams. Thus, the importance and impact of time series analysis and modelling techniques only continues to grow. At the same time, while time series analysis has been extensively studied by econometricians and statisticians, modern time series data often pose significant challenges for the existing techniques both in terms of their structure (e.g., irregular sampling in hospital records and spatiotemporal structure in climate data) and size. Moreover, the focus on time series in the machine learning community has been comparatively much smaller. In fact, the predominant methods in machine learning often assume i.i.d. data streams, which is generally not appropriate for time series data. Thus, there is both a great need and an exciting opportunity for the machine learning community to develop theory, models and algorithms specifically for the purpose of processing and analyzing time series data. We see ICML as a great opportunity to bring together theoretical and applied researchers from around the world and with different backgrounds who are interested in the development and usage of time series analysis and algorithms. This includes methods for time series prediction, classification, clustering, anomaly and change point detection, causal discovery, and dimensionality reduction as well as general theory for learning and analyzing stochastic processes.

"Self-supervised learning is a promising alternative where proxy tasks are developed that allow models and agents to learn without explicit supervision in a way that helps with downstream performance on tasks of interest. One of the major benefits of self-supervised learning is increasing data efficiency: achieving comparable or better performance with less labeled data or fewer environment steps (in Reinforcement learning / Robotics).The field of self-supervised learning (SSL) is rapidly evolving, and the performance of these methods is creeping closer to the fully supervised approaches. However, many of these methods are still developed in domain-specific sub-communities, such as Vision, RL and NLP, even though many similarities exist between them. While SSL is an emerging topic and there is great interest in these techniques, there are currently few workshops, tutorials or other scientific events dedicated to this topic.This workshop aims to bring together experts with different backgrounds and applications areas to share inter-domain ideas and increase cross-pollination, tackle current shortcomings and explore new directions.

This includes:1. curriculum and lifelong learning, where the problem requires learning a sequence of tasks, leveraging their shared structure to enable knowledge transfer2. goal-conditioned reinforcement learning techniques that leverage the structure of the provided goal space to learn many tasks significantly faster3. meta-learning methods that aim to learn efficient learning algorithms that can learn new tasks quickly4. hierarchical reinforcement learning, where the reinforcement learning problem might entail a compositions of subgoals or subtasks with shared structureMulti-task and lifelong reinforcement learning has the potential to alter the paradigm of traditional reinforcement learning, to provide more practical and diverse sources of supervision, while helping overcome many challenges associated with reinforcement learning, such as exploration, sample efficiency and credit assignment. However, the field of multi-task and lifelong reinforcement learning is still young, with many more developments needed in terms of problem formulation, algorithmic and theoretical advances as well as better benchmarking and evaluation.The focus of this workshop will be on both the algorithmic and theoretical foundations of multi-task and lifelong reinforcement learning as well as the practical challenges associated with building multi-tasking agents and lifelong learning benchmarks. Our goal is to bring together researchers that study different problem domains (such as games, robotics, language, and so forth), different optimization approaches (deep learning, evolutionary algorithms, model-based control, etc.), and different formalisms (as mentioned above) to discuss the frontiers, open problems and meaningful next steps in multi-task and lifelong reinforcement learning.

"A diverse set of methods have been devised to develop autonomous driving platforms. They range from modular systems, systems that perform manual decomposition of the problem, systems where the components are optimized independently, and a large number of rules are programmed manually, to end-to-end deep-learning frameworks. Today’s systems rely on a subset of the following: camera images, HD maps, inertial measurement units, wheel encoders, and active 3D sensors (LIDAR, radar). There is a general agreement that much of the self-driving software stack will continue to incorporate some form of machine learning in any of the above mentioned systems in the future.Self-driving cars present one of today’s greatest challenges and opportunities for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Despite substantial investments, existing methods for building autonomous vehicles have not yet succeeded, i.e., there are no driverless cars on public roads today without human safety drivers. Nevertheless, a few groups have started working on extending the idea of learned tasks to larger functions of autonomous driving. Initial results on learned road following are very promising.The goal of this workshop is to explore ways to create a framework that is capable of learning autonomous driving capabilities beyond road following, towards fully driverless cars. The workshop will consider the current state of learning applied to autonomous vehicles and will explore how learning may be used in future systems. The workshop will span both theoretical frameworks and practical issues especially in the area of deep learning.

"Probabilistic modeling has become the de facto framework to reason about uncertainty in Machine Learning and AI. One of the main challenges in probabilistic modeling is the trade-off between the expressivity of the models and the complexity of performing various types of inference, as well as learning them from data. This inherent trade-off is clearly visible in powerful -- but intractable -- models like Markov random fields, (restricted) Boltzmann machines, (hierarchical) Dirichlet processes and Variational Autoencoders. Despite these models’ recent successes, performing inference on them resorts to approximate routines. Moreover, learning such models from data is generally harder as inference is a sub-routine of learning, requiring simplifying assumptions or further approximations. Having guarantees on tractability at inference and learning time is then a highly desired property in many real-world scenarios. Tractable probabilistic modeling (TPM) concerns methods guaranteeing exactly this: performing exact (or tractably approximate) inference and/or learning. To achieve this, the following approaches have been proposed: i) low or bounded-treewidth probabilistic graphical models and determinantal point processes, that exchange expressiveness for efficiency; ii) graphical models with high girth or weak potentials, that provide bounds on the performance of approximate inference methods; and iii) exchangeable probabilistic models that exploit symmetries to reduce inference complexity. More recently, models compiling inference routines into efficient computational graphs such as arithmetic circuits, sum-product networks, cutset networks and probabilistic sentential decision diagrams have advanced the state-of-the-art inference performance by exploiting context-specific independence, determinism or by exploiting latent variables. TPMs have been successfully used in numerous real-world applications: image classification, completion and generation, scene understanding, activity recognition, language and speech modeling, bioinformatics, collaborative filtering, verification and diagnosis of physical systems. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers working on the different fronts of tractable probabilistic modeling, highlighting recent trends and open challenges. At the same time, we want to foster the discussion across similar or complementary sub-fields in the broader probabilistic modeling community. In particular, the rising field of neural probabilistic models, such as normalizing flows and autoregressive models that achieve impressive results in generative modeling. It is an interesting open challenge for the TPM community to keep a broad range of inference routines tractable while leveraging these models’ expressiveness. Furthermore, the rising field of probabilistic programming promises to be the new lingua franca of model-based learning. This offers the TPM community opportunities to push the expressiveness of the models used for general-purpose universal probabilistic languages, such as Pyro, while maintaining efficiency. We want to promote discussions and advance the field both by having high quality contributed works, as well as high level invited speakers coming from the aforementioned tangent sub-fields of probabilistic modeling.

"Though the purview of physics is broad and includes many loosely connected subdisciplines, a unifying theme is the endeavor to provide concise, quantitative, and predictive descriptions of the often large and complex systems governing phenomena that occur in the natural world. While one could debate how closely deep learning is connected to the natural world, it is undeniably the case that deep learning systems are large and complex; as such, it is reasonable to consider whether the rich body of ideas and powerful tools from theoretical physicists could be harnessed to improve our understanding of deep learning. The goal of this workshop is to investigate this question by bringing together experts in theoretical physics and deep learning in order to stimulate interaction and to begin exploring how theoretical physics can shed light on the theory of deep learning.We believe ICML is an appropriate venue for this gathering as members from both communities are frequently in attendance and because deep learning theory has emerged as a focus at the conference, both as an independent track in the main conference and in numerous workshops over the last few years. Moreover, the conference has enjoyed an increasing number of papers using physics tools and ideas to draw insights into deep learning.

"Research at the intersection of vision and language has been attracting a lot of attention in recent years. Topics include the study of multi-modal representations, translation between modalities, bootstrapping of labels from one modality into another, visually-grounded question answering, segmentation and storytelling, and grounding the meaning of language in visual data. An ever-increasing number of tasks and datasets are appearing around this recently-established field. At NeurIPS 2018, we released the How2 data-set, containing more than 85,000 (2000h) videos, with audio, transcriptions, translations, and textual summaries. We believe it presents an ideal resource to bring together researchers working on the previously mentioned separate tasks around a single, large dataset. This rich dataset will facilitate the comparison of tools and algorithms, and hopefully foster the creation of additional annotations and tasks. We want to foster discussion about useful tasks, metrics, and labeling techniques, in order to develop a better understanding of the role and value of multi-modality in vision and language. We seek to create a venue to encourage collaboration between different sub-fields, and help establish new research directions and collaborations that we believe will sustain machine learning research for years to come.

"Recent years have seen a surge in research on graph representation learning, including techniques for deep graph embeddings, generalizations of CNNs to graph-structured data, and neural message-passing approaches. These advances in graph neural networks and related techniques have led to new state-of-the-art results in numerous domains: chemical synthesis, 3D-vision, recommender systems, question answering, continuous control, self-driving and social network analysis. Building on the successes of three related workshops from last year (at ICML, ICLR and NeurIPS), the primary goal for this workshop is to facilitate community building, and support expansion of graph representation learning into more interdisciplinary projects with the natural and social sciences.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning systems in particular, often depend on the information provided by multiple agents. The most well-known example is federated learning, but also sensor data, crowdsourced human computation, or human trajectory inputs for inverse reinforcement learning. However, eliciting accurate data can be costly, either due to the effort invested in obtaining it, as in crowdsourcing, or due to the need to maintain automated systems, as in distributed sensor systems. Low-quality data not only degrades the performance of AI systems, but may also pose safety concerns. Thus, it becomes important to verify the correctness of data and be smart in how data is aggregated, and to provide incentives to promote effort and high-quality data. During the recent workshop on Federated Learning at NeurIPS 2019, 4 of 6 panel members mentioned incentives as the most important open issue.This workshop is proposed to understand this aspect of Machine Learning, both theoretically and empirically. We particularly encourage contributions on the following aspects:- How to collect high quality and credible data for machine learning systems from self-interested and possibly malicious agents, considering the game-theoretical properties of the problem?- How to evaluate the quality of data supplied by self-interested and possibly malicious agents and how to optimally aggregate it?- How to make use of machine learning in game-theoretic mechanisms that will facilitate the collection of high-quality data?

"There has been growing interest in rectifying deep neural network instabilities. Challenges arise when models receive samples drawn from outside the training distribution. For example, a neural network tasked with classifying handwritten digits may assign high confidence predictions to cat images. Anomalies are frequently encountered when deploying ML models in the real world. Well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates are indispensable for many machine learning applications, such as self-driving vehicles and medical diagnosis systems. Generalization to unseen and worst-case inputs is also essential for robustness to distributional shift. In order to have ML models reliably predict in open environment, we must deepen technical understanding in the emerging areas of: (1) learning algorithms that can detect  changes in data distribution (e.g. out-of-distribution examples); (2) mechanisms to estimate and calibrate confidence produced by neural networks in typical and unforeseen scenarios; (3) methods to improve out-of-distribution generalization, including generalization to temporal, geographical, hardware, adversarial, and image-quality changes; (4) benchmark datasets and protocols for evaluating model performance under distribution shift; and (5) key applications of robust and uncertainty-aware deep learning (e.g., computer vision, robotics, self-driving vehicles, medical imaging) as well as broader machine learning tasks.This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from the machine learning communities, and highlight recent work that contributes to addressing these challenges. Our agenda will feature contributed papers with invited speakers. Through the workshop we hope to help identify fundamentally important directions on robust and reliable deep learning, and foster future collaborations.

"Description: the workshop proposal in “Law and Machine Learning” aims to contribute to the research on social and legal risks of the deployment of AI systems using machine learning based decisions. Today, algorithms have been infiltrating and governing every aspect of our lives as individuals and as a society. Specifically, Algorithmic Decision Systems (ADS) are involved in many social decisions. For instance, such systems are increasingly used to support decision-making in fields, such as child welfare, criminal justice, school assignment, teacher evaluation, fire risk assessment, homelessness prioritization, healthcare, Medicaid benefit, immigration decision systems or risk assessment, and predictive policing, among other things. Law enforcement agencies are increasingly using facial recognition, algorithmic predictive policing systems to forecast criminal activity and allocate police resources. However, these predictive systems challenge fundamental rights and guarantees of the criminal procedure. For several years, numerous studies have revealed, social risks of ML, especially the risks of opacity, bias, manipulation of information.While it is only the starting point of the deployment of such systems, more interdisciplinary research is needed. Our purpose is to contribute to this new field which brings together legal researchers, mathematicians and computer scientists, by bridging the gap between the performance of algorithmic systems and legal standards. For instance, notions like “privacy” or “fairness” are formulated in law, as well as mathematical definitions in computer science. However, the meaning and the impact of such requirements are not necessarily identical. Besides, legal norms to regulate AI systems appear in certain national laws but have to be relevant and compatible with technical requirements. Furthermore, these standards must be checked by legal experts and regulators, which presupposes that AI systems are sufficiently meaningful and transparent. These issues emerge in different topics, such as privacy in data analysis and fairness in algorithmic decision-making. The topic will cover the research that denounces the risks and, above all, multidisciplinary research that proposes solutions, especially legal and technical solutions.

"Extreme classification is a rapidly growing research area focusing on multi-class and multi-label problems, where the label space is extremely large. It brings many diverse approaches under the same umbrella including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, information retrieval, recommendation systems, computational advertising, and embedding methods. Extreme classifiers have been deployed in many real-world applications in the industry ranging from language modelling to document tagging in NLP, face recognition to learning universal feature representations in computer vision, etc. Moreover, extreme classification finds application in recommendation, tagging, and ranking systems since these problems can be reformulated as multi-label learning tasks where each item to be ranked or recommended is treated as a separate label. Such reformulations have led to significant gains over traditional collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation techniques. The proposed workshop aims to offer a timely collection of information to benefit the researchers and practitioners working in the aforementioned research fields of core supervised learning, theory of extreme classification, as well as application domains. These issues are well-covered by the Topics of Interest in ICML 2020. The workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in these areas to encourage discussion, facilitate interaction and collaboration and improve upon the state-of-the-art in extreme classification. The workshop will provide plethora of opportunities for research discussions, including poster sessions, invited talks, contributed talks, and a panel. During the panel the speakers will discuss challenges & opportunities in the field of extreme classification, in particular: 1) how to deal with the long tail labels problem?, 2) how to effectively combine deep learning approaches with extreme multi-label classification techniques?, 3) how to develop the theoretical foundations for this area?

"The designers of a machine learning (ML) system typically have far more power over the system than the individuals who are ultimately impacted by the system and its decisions. Recommender platforms shape the users’ preferences; the individuals classified by a model often do not have means to contest a decision; and the data required by supervised ML systems necessitates that the privacy and labour of many yield to the design choices of a few.The fields of algorithmic fairness and human-centered ML often focus on centralized solutions, lending increasing power to system designers and operators, and less to users and affected populations. In response to the growing social-science critique of the power imbalance present in the research, design, and deployment of ML systems, we wish to consider a new set of technical formulations for the ML community on the subject of more democratic, cooperative, and participatory ML systems.Our workshop aims to explore methods that, by design, enable and encourage the perspectives of those impacted by an ML system to shape the system and its decisions.

biological data, such as genetic sequences, cellular features or protein structures, and imaging
datasets to make new predictions towards clinical response, discover new biology or aid drug

A key open question is how to make machine learning effective and robust enough to operate in real world open domains.<br><br>Artificial {\it open} worlds are ideal laboratories for studying how to extend the successes of ML to build such agents. <br>Open worlds are characterized by:<br>\begin{itemize}<br>    \item Large (or perhaps infinite) collections of tasks, often not specified till test time; or lack of well defined tasks altogether (despite there being lots to do).<br>    \itemunbounded'' environments, long ``epsiodes''; or no episodes at all.    \item Many interacting agents; more generally, emergent behavior from interactions with the environment.\end{itemize}On one hand, they retain many of the challenging features of the real world with respect to studying learning agents.

"Although data is considered to be the “new oil”, it is very hard to be priced. Raw use of data has been invaluable in several sectors such as advertising, healthcare, etc, but often in violation of people’s privacy. Labeled data has also been extremely valuable for the training of machine learning models (driverless car industry). This is also indicated by the growth of annotation companies such as Figure8 and Scale.AI, especially in the image space. Yet, it is not clear what is the right pricing for data workers who annotate the data or the individuals who contribute their personal data while using digital services. In the latter case, it is very unclear how the value of the services offered is compared to the private data exchanged.  While the first data marketplaces have appeared, such as AWS, Narattive.io, nitrogen.ai, etc, they suffer from a lack of good pricing models.

"Analysis of large amounts of data offers new opportunities to understand many processes better. Yet, data accumulation often implies relaxing acquisition procedures or compounding diverse sources, leading to many observations with missing features. From questionnaires to collaborative filtering, from electronic health records to single-cell analysis, missingness is everywhere at play and is rather the norm than the exception. Even “clean” data sets are often barely “cleaned” versions of incomplete data sets—with all the unfortunate biases this cleaning process may have created.Despite this ubiquity, tackling missing values is often overlooked.  Handling missing values poses many challenges, and there is a vast literature in the statistical community, with many implementations available. Yet, there are still many open issues and the need to design new methods or to introduce new point of views: for missing values in a supervised-learning setting, in deep learning architectures, to adapt available methods for high dimensional observed data with different type of missing values, deal with feature mismatch and distribution mismatch. Missing data is one of the eight pillars of causal wisdom for Judea Pearl who brought graphical model reasoning to tackle some missing not at random values.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first workshop at the major machine learning conferences focusing primarily on missing value problems in recent years. The goal of our workshop is to give more momentum and exposition to research on missing values, both theoretical and methodological, and emphasize the connections with other areas of machine learning (e.g. causal inference, generative modelling, uncertainty quantification, transfer learning, distributional shift, etc.).

"Objects, and the interactions between them, are the foundations on which our understanding of the world is built. Similarly, abstractions centered around the perception and representation of objects play a key role in building human-like AI, supporting high-level cognitive abilities like causal reasoning, object-centric exploration, and problem solving. Indeed, prior works have shown how relational reasoning and control problems can greatly benefit from having object descriptions. Yet, many of the current methods in machine learning focus on a less structured approach in which objects are only implicitly represented, posing a challenge for interpretability and the reuse of knowledge across tasks. Motivated by the above observations, there has been a recent effort to reinterpret various learning problems from the perspective of object-oriented representations.In this workshop, we will showcase a variety of approaches in object-oriented learning, with three particular emphases. Our first interest is in learning object representations in an unsupervised manner. Although computer vision has made an enormous amount of progress in learning about objects via supervised methods, we believe that learning about objects with little to no supervision is preferable: it minimizes labeling costs, and also supports adaptive representations that can be changed depending on the particular situation and goal. The second primary interest of this workshop is to explore how object-oriented representations can be leveraged for downstream tasks such as reinforcement learning and causal reasoning. Lastly, given the central importance of objects in human cognition, we will highlight interdisciplinary perspectives from cognitive science and neuroscience on how people perceive and understand objects.We have invited speakers whose research programs cover unsupervised and supervised 2-D and 3-D perception, reasoning, concept learning, reinforcement learning, as well as psychology and neuroscience. We will additionally source contributed works focusing on unsupervised object-centric representations, applications of such object-oriented representations (such as in reinforcement learning), and object-centric aspects of human cognition.

"Even though supervised learning using large annotated corpora is still the dominant approach in machine learning,  self-supervised learning is gaining considerable popularity.  Applying self-supervised learning to audio and speech sequences, however, remains particularly challenging. Speech signals, in fact, are not only high-dimensional, long, and variable-length sequences, but also entail a complex hierarchical structure that is difficult to infer without supervision (e.g.phonemes, syllables, words). Moreover, speech is characterized by an important variability due to different speaker identities, accents, recording conditions and noises that highly increase the level of complexity.We believe that self-supervised learning will play a crucial role in the future of artificial intelligence, and we think that great research effort is needed to efficiently take advantage of it in audio and speech applications. With our initiative, we wish to foster more progress in the field, and we hope to encourage a discussion amongst experts and practitioners from both academia and industry that might bring different points of view on this topic. Furthermore, we plan to extend the debate to multiple disciplines, encouraging discussions on how insights from other fields (e.g., computer vision and robotics) can be applied to speech, and how findings on speech can be used on other sequence processing tasks. The workshop will be conceived to promote communication and exchange of ideas between machine learning and speech communities.

Our hope is that our proposed XXAI workshop can accelerate this process, foster a more systematic use of XAI to produce improvement on models in applications, and finally, also serves to better identify in which way current XAI methods need to be improved and what kind of theory of XAI is needed.

"One of the most significant and challenging open problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the problem of Lifelong Learning. Lifelong Machine Learning considers systems that can continually learn many tasks (from one or more domains) over a lifetime. A lifelong learning system efficiently and effectively:1. retains the knowledge it has learned from different tasks;2. selectively transfers knowledge (from previously learned tasks) to facilitate the learning of new tasks;3. ensures the effective and efficient interaction between (1) and (2).Lifelong Learning introduces several fundamental challenges in training models that generally do not arise in a single task batch learning setting. This includes problems like catastrophic forgetting and capacity saturation. This workshop aims to explore solutions for these problems in both supervised learning and reinforcement learning settings.

"The ever-increasing size and accessibility of vast media libraries has created a demand more than ever for AI-based systems that are capable of organizing, recommending, and understanding such complex data. While this topic has received only limited attention within the core machine learning community, it has been an area of intense focus within the applied communities such as the Recommender Systems (RecSys), Music Information Retrieval (MIR), and Computer Vision communities. At the same time, these domains have surfaced nebulous problem spaces and rich datasets that are of tremendous potential value to machine learning and the AI communities at large.This year's Machine Learning for Media Discovery (ML4MD) aims to build upon the five previous Machine Learning for Music Discovery editions at ICML, broadening the topic area from music discovery to media discovery. The added topic diversity is aimed towards having a broader conversation with the machine learning community and to offer cross-pollination across the various media domains.One of the largest areas of focus in the media discovery space is on the side of content understanding. The recommender systems community has made great advances in terms of collaborative feedback recommenders, but these approaches suffer strongly from the cold-start problem.  As such, recommendation techniques often fall back on content-based machine learning systems, but defining the similarity of media items is extremely challenging as myriad features all play some role (e.g., cultural, emotional, or content features, etc.). While significant progress has been made, these problems remain far from solved.In addition, these complex data present many challenges beyond the development of machine learning systems to model and understand them. One of the largest challenges is scale. One example is commercial music libraries, which span into the tens of millions. However, user-generated content platforms such as YouTube and Pinterest have libraries stretching into the billions--a scale at which many of the traditional approaches discussed in the literature simply cannot perform. On the other side of this problem sits the recent explosion of work in the area of Creative AI. Relevant examples include Google Magenta, Amazon's DeepComposer, who seek to develop algorithms capable of composing and performing completely original (and compelling) works of music. The same also happens in the world of visual media creation (e.g., DeepDream, Deep Fakes). Certain work in this area adds an interesting dimension to the conversation as understanding how content is created is a prerequisite to generating. This workshop proposal is timely in that it will bridge these separate pockets of otherwise very related research. In addition to making progress on the challenges above, we hope to engage the wide AI and machine learning community with our rich problem space, and connect them with the many available datasets the community has to offer.

"Optimization lies at the heart of many exciting developments in machine learning, statistics and signal processing. As models become more complex and datasets get larger, finding efficient, reliable and provable methods is one of the primary goals in these fields.In the last few decades, much effort has been devoted to the development of first-order methods. These methods enjoy a low per-iteration cost and have optimal complexity, are easy to implement, and have proven to be effective for most machine learning applications. First-order methods, however, have significant limitations: (1) they require fine hyper-parameter tuning, (2) they do not incorporate curvature information, and thus are sensitive to ill-conditioning, and (3) they are often unable to fully exploit the power of distributed computing architectures.Higher-order methods, such as Newton, quasi-Newton and adaptive gradient descent methods, are extensively used in many scientific and engineering domains. At least in theory, these methods possess several nice features: they exploit local curvature information to mitigate the effects of ill-conditioning, they avoid or diminish the need for hyper-parameter tuning, and they have enough concurrency to take advantage of distributed computing environments. Researchers have even developed stochastic versions of higher-order methods, that feature speed and scalability by incorporating curvature information in an economical and judicious manner. However, often higher-order methods are “undervalued.”This workshop will attempt to shed light on this statement. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, second-order methods, adaptive gradient descent methods, regularization techniques, as well as techniques based on higher-order derivatives.

"Until recently, Machine Learning has been mostly applied in industry by consulting academics, data scientists within larger companies, and a number of dedicated Machine Learning research labs within a few of the world’s most innovative tech companies. Over the last few years we have seen the dramatic rise of companies dedicated to providing Machine Learning software-as-a-service tools, with the aim of democratizing access to the benefits of Machine Learning. All these efforts have revealed major hurdles to ensuring the continual delivery of good performance from deployed Machine Learning systems.

"The ICML Workshop on Retrospectives in Machine Learning will build upon the success of the 2019 NeurIPS Retrospectives workshop to further encourage the publication of retrospectives. A retrospective of a paper or a set of papers, by its author, takes the form of an informal paper. It provides a venue for authors to reflect on their previous publications, to talk about how their thoughts have changed following publication, to identify shortcomings in their analysis or results, and to discuss resulting extensions. The overarching goal of MLRetrospectives is to improve the science, openness, and accessibility of the machine learning field, by widening what is publishable and helping to identify opportunities for improvement. Retrospectives also give researchers and practitioners unable to attend conferences access to the author’s updated understanding of their work, which would otherwise only be accessible to their immediate circle. The machine learning community would benefit from retrospectives on much of the research which shapes our field, and this workshop will present an opportunity for a few retrospectives to be presented.

"ML has shown great promise in modeling and predicting complex phenomenon in many scientificdisciples such as predicting cardiovascular risk factors from retinal images, understanding howelectrons behave at the atomic level [3], identifying patterns of weather and climate phenomena, etc.  Further, models are able to learn directly (and better) from raw data as opposed to human selected features.  The ability to interpret the model and find significant predictors couldprovide new scientific insights.Traditionally, the scientific discovery process has been based on careful observations of nat-ural  phenomenon,  followed  by  systematic  human  analysis  (of  hypothesis  generation  and  ex-perimental validation).  ML interpretability has the potential to bring a radically different yetprincipled approach.  While general interpretability relies on ‘human parsing’ (common sense),scientific domains have semi-structured and highly structured bases for interpretation.  Thus,despite differences in data modalities and domains, be it brain sciences, the behavioral sciences,or  material  sciences,  there  is  a  need  for  a  common  set  of  tools  that  address  a  similar  flavor of problem, one of interpretability or fitting models to a known structure. This workshop aims to bring together members from the ML and physical sciences communities to introduce exciting problems to the broader community, and stimulate the productionof new approaches towards solving open scientific problems.

"One proposed solution towards the goal of designing machines that can extrapolate experience across environments and tasks, are inductive biases. Providing and starting algorithms with inductive biases might help to learn invariances e.g. a causal graph structure, which in turn will allow the agent to generalize across environments and tasks. While some inductive biases are already available and correspond to common knowledge, one key requirement to learn inductive biases from data seems to be the possibility to perform and learn from interventions. This assumption is partially motivated by the accepted hypothesis in psychology about the need to experiment in order to discover causal relationships. This corresponds to an reinforcement learning environment, where the agent can discover causal factors through interventions and observing their effects. We believe that one reason which has hampered progress on building intelligent agents is the limited availability of good inductive biases. Learning inductive biases from data is difficult since this corresponds to an interactive learning setting, which compared to classical regression or classification frameworks is far less understood e.g. even formal definitions of generalization in RL have not been developed.  While Reinforcement Learning has already achieved impressive results, the sample complexity required to achieve consistently good performance is often prohibitively high. This has limited most RL to either games or settings where an accurate simulator is available.  Another issue is that RL agents are often brittle in the face of even tiny changes to the environment (either visual or mechanistic changes) unseen in the training phase.  To build intuition for the scope of the generalization problem in RL, consider the task of training a robotic car mechanic that can diagnose and repair any problem with a car. Current methods are all insufficient in some respect -- on-policy policy gradient algorithms need to cycle through all possible broken cars on every single iteration, off-policy algorithms end up with a mess of instability due to perception and highly diverse data, and model-based methods may struggle to fully estimate a complex web of causality.  In our workshop we hope to explore research and new ideas on topics related to inductive biases, invariances and generalization, including: - What are efficient ways to learn inductive biases from data?- Which inductive biases are most suitable to achieve generalization? - Can we make the problem of generalization in particular for RL more concrete and figure out standard terms for discussing the problem?  - Causality and generalization especially in RL- Model-based RL and generalization.  - Sample Complexity in reinforcement learning. - Can we create models that are robust visual environments, assuming all the underlying mechanics are the same. Should this count as generalization or transfer learning?- Robustness to changes in the mechanics of the environment, such as scaling of rewards.  - Can we create a theoretical understanding of generalization in RL, and understand how it is related to the well developed ideas from statistical learning theory.  - in RL, the training data is collected by the agent and it is affected by the agent's policy. Therefore, the training distribution is not a fixed distribution.  How does this affect how we should think about generalization?  The question of generalization in reinforcement learning is essential to the field’s future both in theory and in practice.  However there are still open questions about the right way to think about generalization in RL, the right way to formalize the problem, and the most important tasks.  This workshop would help to address this issue by bringing together researchers from different backgrounds to discuss these challenges.

"Normalizing flows are explicit likelihood models using invertible neural networks to construct flexible probability distributions of high-dimensional data.  Compared to other generative models,  the main advantage of normalizing flows is that they can offer exact and efficient likelihood computation and data generation.  Since their recent introduction, flow-based models have seen a significant resurgence of interest in the machine learning community.  As a result, powerful flow-based models have been developed, with successes in density estimation, variational inference, and generative modeling of images, audio and video. This workshop is the 2nd iteration of the ICML 2019 workshop on Invertible Neural Networks and Normalizing Flows.  While the main goal of last year’s workshop was to make flow-based models more accessible to the general machine learning community, as the field is moving forward, we believe there is now a need to consolidate recent progress and connect ideas from related fields.  In light of the interpretation of latent variable models and autoregressive models as flows, this year we expand the scope of the workshop and consider likelihood-based models more broadly, including flow-based models, latent variable models and autoregressive models.  We encourage the researchers to use these models in conjunction to exploit the their benefits at once, and to work together to resolve some common issues of likelihood-based methods, such as mis-calibration of out-of-distribution uncertainty.

"Machine learning systems are commonly applied to isolated tasks or narrow domains (e.g. control over similar robotic bodies). It is further assumed that the learning system has simultaneous access to all the data points of the tasks at hand. In contrast, Continual Learning (CL) studies the problem of learning from a stream of data from changing domains, each connected to a diﬀerent learning task. The objective of CL is to quickly adapt to new situations or tasks by exploiting previously acquired knowledge, while protecting previous learning from being erased. Meeting the objectives of CL will provide an opportunity for systems to quickly learn new skills given knowledge accumulated in the past and continually extend their capabilities to changing environments, a hallmark of natural intelligence.

"Deep learning has achieved great success in a variety of tasks such as recognizing objects in images, predicting the sentiment of sentences, or image/speech synthesis by training on a large-amount of data. However, most existing success are mainly focusing on perceptual tasks, which is also known as System I intelligence. In real world, many complicated tasks, such as autonomous driving, public policy decision making, and multi-hop question answering, require understanding the relationship between high-level variables in the data to perform logical reasoning, which is known as System II intelligence. Integrating system I and II intelligence lies in the core of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Graph is an important structure for System II intelligence, with the universal representation ability to capture the relationship between different variables, and support interpretability, causality, and transferability / inductive generalization. Traditional logic and symbolic reasoning over graphs has relied on methods and tools which are very different from deep learning models, such Prolog language, SMT solvers, constrained optimization and discrete algorithms. Is such a methodology separation between System I and System II intelligence necessary? How to build a flexible, effective and efficient bridge to smoothly connect these two systems, and create higher order artificial intelligence? Graph neural networks, have emerged as the tool of choice for graph representation learning, which has led to impressive progress in many classification and regression problems such as chemical synthesis, 3D-vision, recommender systems and social network analysis. However, prediction and classification tasks can be very different from logic/symbolic reasoning.Bits and pieces of evidence can be gleaned from recent literature, suggesting graph neural networks may be a general tool to make such a connection. For example, \cite{battaglia2018relational,barcelo2019logical} viewed graph neural networks as tools to incorporate explicitly logic reasoning bias. \cite{kipf2018neural} used graph neural network to reason about interacting systems, \cite{yoon2018inference,zhang2020efficient} used neural networks for logic and probabilistic inference, \cite{hudson2019learning, hu2019language} used graph neural networks for reasoning on scene graphs for visual question reasoning, \cite{qu2019probabilistic} studied reasoning on knowledge graphs with graph neural networks, and \cite{khalil2017learning, xu2018powerful, velickovic2019neural, sato2019approximation} used graph neural networks for discrete graph algorithms. However, there can still be a long way to go for a satisfactory and definite answers on the ability of graph neural networks for automatically discovering logic rules, and conducting long-range multi-step complex reasoning in combination with perception inputs such as language, vision, spatial and temporal variation.   {\bf Can graph neural networks be the key bridge to connect System I and System II intelligence? Are there  other more flexible, effective and efficient alternatives?} For instance, \citep{wang2019satnet} combined max satisfiability solver with deep learning, \citep{manhaeve2018deepproblog} combined directed graphical and Problog with deep learning, \citep{skryagin2020splog}~combined sum product network with deep learning, \citep{silver2019few,alet2019graph}~combined logic reasoning with reinforcement learning. How do these alternative methods compare with graph neural networks for being a bridge?The goal of this workshop is to bring researchers from previously separate fields, such as deep learning, logic/symbolic reasoning, statistical relational learning, and graph algorithms, into a common roof to discuss this potential interface and integration between System I and System intelligence.

Such agents usually involve applications in computer vision, natural language processing, human computer interaction, and robotics. Creating and running such agents call for interdisciplinary research of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software engineering design, which we abstract as Human in the Loop Learning (HILL). HILL is a modern machine learning paradigm of significant practical and theoretical interest. For HILL, models and humans engage in a two-way dialog to facilitate more accurate and interpretable learning. The workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on the broad areas of human in the loop learning, ranging from the interactive/active learning algorithm designs for real-world decision making systems (e.g., autonomous driving vehicles, robotic systems, etc.), models with strong explainability, as well as interactive system designs  (e.g., data visualization, annotation systems, etc.). In particular, we aim to elicit new connections among these diverse fields, identifying theory, tools and design principles tailored to practical machine learning workflows.

"Machine learning (ML) systems have been increasingly used in many applications, ranging from decision-making systems to safety-critical tasks. While the hope is to improve decision-making accuracy and societal outcomes with these ML models, concerns have been incurred that they can inflict harm if not developed or used with care. It has been well-documented that ML models can: (1) inherit pre-existing biases and exhibit discrimination against already-disadvantaged or marginalized social groups; (2) be vulnerable to security and privacy attacks that deceive the models and leak the training data's sensitive information; (3) make hard-to-justify predictions with a lack of transparency. Therefore, it is essential to build socially responsible ML models that are fair, robust, private, transparent, and interpretable.Although extensive studies have been conducted to increase trust in ML, many of them either focus on well-defined problems that enable nice tractability from a mathematical perspective but are hard to adapt to real-world systems, or they mainly focus on mitigating risks in real-world applications without providing theoretical justifications. Moreover, most work studies those issues separately; the connections among them are less well-understood. This workshop aims to build connections by bringing together both theoretical and applied researchers from various communities (e.g., machine learning, fairness & ethics, security, privacy, etc.).

However, theoretical understanding is still lagging behind.

Many real life applications share common assumptions and settings with CL, what are the convergence guarantees when deploying a certain method? If memory capacity is an important constraint for replay methods, how can we select the minimal examples such that CF is minimized? While answers to the questions above are key ingredients to design better heuristics, very little theoretical guidance is provided in the literature.The aim of this workshop is to achieve an understanding of different components of continual learning to bridge the gap with empirical results.

"As causality enjoys increasing attention in various areas of machine learning, this workshop turns the spotlight on the assumptions behind the successful application of causal inference techniques. It is well known that answering causal queries from observational data requires strong and sometimes untestable assumptions. On the theoretical side, a whole host of settings as been established in which causal effects are identifiable and consistently estimable under a set of by now considered ""standard"" assumptions. While these can be reasonable in specific scenarios, they were often at least partially motivated by rendering estimation theoretically feasible. Such assumptions tell us what we would need to assert about the data generating process in order to be able to answer causal queries. Unfortunately, in applications we often find them taken for granted as properties that can safely be assumed to hold without further scrutiny. This starts with fundamentally untestable assumptions such as the stable unit treatment value assumption or ignorability and continues to no interference, faithfulness, positivity or overlap, no unobserved confounding and even reaches blanket one-size-fits all assumptions on the linearity of structural equations or the additivity of noise. This situation may lead practitioners to either believe that well founded causal inference is unattainable altogether, or that established off-the-shelf methods can be trusted to deliver reliable causal estimates in virtually any situation. Similarly, as ideas from causality are increasingly picked up by researchers in deep-, reinforcement-, or meta-learning, there is a risk that the role of assumptions for causal inference gets lost in translation. One of the main goals of this workshop is to help the research community and practitioners understand the concrete challenges of trustworthy assumptions for effective causal inference.

"As the use of machine learning (ML) becomes ubiquitous, there is a growing understanding and appreciation for the role that data plays for building successful ML solutions.

"Modern machine learning models are often highly over-parameterized. The prime examples are neural network architectures achieving state-of-the-art performance, which have many more parameters than training examples. While these models can empirically perform very well, they are not well understood. Worst-case theories of learnability do not explain their behavior. Indeed, over-parameterized models sometimes exhibit ""benign overfitting"", i.e., they have the power to perfectly fit training data (even data modified to have random labels), yet they achieve good performance on the test data. There is evidence that over-parameterization may be helpful both computational and statistically, although attempts to use phenomena like double/multiple descent to explain that over-parameterization helps to achieve small test error remain controversial. Besides benign overfitting and double/multiple descent, many other interesting phenomena arise due to over-parameterization, and many more may have yet to be discovered. Many of these effects depend on the properties of data, but we have only simplistic tools to measure, quantify, and understand data. In light of rapid progress and rapidly shifting understanding, we believe that the time is ripe for a workshop focusing on understanding over-parameterization from multiple angles.Gathertown room1 link: https://eventhosts.gather.town/DbHJbA5ArXpTIoap/icml-oppo-2021Gathertown room2 link: https://eventhosts.gather.town/UtqQ3jSJ7wnN0anj/icml-oppo-2021-room-2

"Applying machine learning (ML) in healthcare is gaining momentum rapidly. However, the black-box characteristics of existing ML approaches inevitably lead to less interpretability and verifiability in making clinical predictions. To enhance the interpretability of medical intelligence, it becomes critical to develop methodologies to explain predictions as these systems are pervasively being introduced to the healthcare domain, which requires a higher level of safety and security. Such methodologies would make medical decisions more trustworthy and reliable for physicians, which could facilitate the deployment ultimately. On the other hand, it is also essential to develop more interpretable and transparent ML systems. For instance, by exploiting structured knowledge or prior clinical information, one can design models to learn aspects more coherent with clinical reasoning. Also, it may help mitigate biases in the learning process, or identify more relevant variables for making medical decisions.In this workshop, we aim to bring together researchers in ML, computer vision, healthcare, medicine, NLP, and clinical fields to facilitate discussions including related challenges, definition, formalisms, evaluation protocols regarding interpretable medical machine intelligence. Additionally, we will also introduce possible solutions such as logic and symbolic reasoning over medical knowledge graphs, uncertainty quantification, composition models, etc. We hope that the proposed workshop is fruitful in offering a step toward building autonomous clinical decision systems with a higher-level understanding of interpretability.

"Training machine learning models in a centralized fashion often faces significant challenges due to regulatory and privacy concerns in real-world use cases. These include distributed training data, computational resources to create and maintain a central data repository, and regulatory guidelines (GDPR, HIPAA) that restrict sharing sensitive data. Federated learning (FL) is a new paradigm in machine learning that can mitigate these challenges by training a global model using distributed data, without the need for data sharing. The extensive application of machine learning to analyze and draw insight from real-world, distributed, and sensitive data necessitates familiarization with and adoption of this relevant and timely topic among the scientific community. Despite the advantages of FL, and its successful application in certain industry-based cases, this field is still in its infancy due to new challenges that are imposed by limited visibility of the training data, potential lack of trust among participants training a single model, potential privacy inferences, and in some cases, limited or unreliable connectivity.The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in FL. This day-long event will facilitate interaction among students, scholars, and industry professionals from around the world to understand the topic, identify technical challenges, and discuss potential solutions. This will lead to an overall advancement of FL and its impact in the community, while noting that FL has become an increasingly popular topic in the ICML community in recent years.

"Normalizing flows are explicit likelihood models (ELM) characterized by a flexible invertible reparameterization of high-dimensional probability distributions. Unlike other ELMs, they offer both exact and efficient likelihood computation and data generation.  Since their recent introduction, flow-based models have seen a significant resurgence of interest in the machine learning community.  As a result, powerful flow-based models have been developed, with successes in density estimation, variational inference, and generative modeling of images, audio and video. 
As the field is moving forward, the main goal of the workshop is to consolidate recent progress and connect ideas from related fields.  Over the past few years, we’ve seen that normalizing flows are deeply connected to latent variable models, autoregressive models, and more recently, diffusion-based generative models.  This year, we would like to further push the forefront of these explicit likelihood models through the lens of invertible reparameterization.  We encourage researchers to use these models in conjunction to exploit the their benefits at once, and to work together to resolve some common issues of likelihood-based methods, such as mis-calibration of out-of-distribution uncertainty.

"One of the fundamental promises of deep learning is its ability to build increasingly meaningful representations of data from complex but raw inputs. These techniques demonstrate remarkable efficacy on high dimensional data with unique proximity structures (image, natural language, graphs). 
Not only are these types of data prevalent in financial services and e-commerce, but also they often capture extremely interesting aspects of social and economic behavior. For example, financial transactions and online purchases can be viewed as edges on graphs of economic activity. To date, these graphs are far less studied than social networks, though they provide a unique look at behavior, social structures, and risk. ​Meanwhile, activity or transaction sequences, usually determined by user sessions, can reflect the users’ long term and short term interests, which can be modeled by sequential models, and used to predict the user’s future activities. Although language models have been explored in session data modeling, how to re-use the representations learned from one job to another job effectively is still an open question.
Our goal is to bring together researchers from different domains to discuss the application of representation learning to financial services and e-commerce. For the first time, four major e-commerce companies (Amazon, Walmart, Alibaba and eBay) and two banks (JP Morgan and Capital One) have come together to organize this workshop along with researchers from academia. A shared goal across these industries and application areas is to transform large-scale representational data into tangible revenue for businesses. Towards this goal, our confirmed invited speakers will share diverse perspectives on ways that representation learning can be used to solve problems in financial services and e-commerce. This will also be a forum to share how research on financial services and e-commerce data provides unique insights into socio-economic behavior.

"Recent years have witnessed the rising need for the machine learning systems that can interact with humans in the learning loop. Such systems can be applied to computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and human computer interaction. Creating and running such systems call for interdisciplinary research of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software engineering design, which we abstract as Human in the Loop Learning (HILL). The HILL workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on the broad areas of HILL, ranging from the interactive/active learning algorithms for real-world decision making systems (e.g., autonomous driving vehicles, robotic systems, etc.), lifelong learning systems that retain knowledge from different tasks and selectively transfer knowledge to learn new tasks over a lifetime, models with strong explainability, as well as interactive system designs  (e.g., data visualization, annotation systems, etc.). The HILL workshop continues the previous effort to provide a platform for researchers from interdisciplinary areas to share their recent research. In this year’s workshop, a special feature is to encourage the debate between HILL and label-efficient learning: Are these two learning paradigms contradictory with each other, or can they be organically combined to create a more powerful learning system? We believe the theme of the workshop will be of interest for broad ICML attendees, especially those who are interested in interdisciplinary study.

"Machine learning is increasingly used to inform decision-making in sensitive situations where decisions have consequential effects on individuals' lives. In these settings, in addition to requiring models to be accurate and robust, socially relevant values such as fairness, privacy, accountability, and explainability play an important role for the adoption and impact of said technologies. In this workshop, we focus on algorithmic recourse, which is concerned with providing explanations and recommendations to individuals who are unfavourably treated by automated decision-making systems. Specifically, we plan to facilitate workshop interactions that will shed light onto the following 3 questions: (i) What are the practical, legal and ethical considerations that decision-makers need to account for when providing recourse? (ii) How do humans understand and act based on recourse explanations from a psychological and behavioral perspective? (iii) What are the main technical advances in explainability and causality in ML required for achieving recourse? Our ultimate goal is to foster conversations that will help bridge the gaps arising from the interdisciplinary nature of algorithmic recourse and contribute towards the wider adoption of such methods.

"Unsupervised learning has begun to deliver on its promise in the recent past with tremendous progress made in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision whereby large scale unsupervised pre-training has enabled fine-tuning to downstream supervised learning tasks with limited labeled data. This is particularly encouraging and appealing in the context of reinforcement learning considering that it is expensive to perform rollouts in the real world with annotations either in the form of reward signals or human demonstrations.

"The empirical success of state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques has outpaced their theoretical understanding. Deep learning models, for example, perform far better than classical statistical learning theory predicts, leading to its widespread use by Industry and Government. At the same time, the deployment of ML systems that are not fully understood often leads to unexpected and detrimental individual-level impact. Finally, the large-scale adoption of ML means that ML systems are now critical infrastructure on which millions rely. In the face of these challenges, there is a critical need for theory that provides rigorous performance guarantees for practical ML models; guides the responsible deployment of ML in applications of social consequence; and enables the design of reliable ML systems in large-scale, distributed environments.
For decades, information theory has provided a mathematical foundation for the systems and algorithms that fuel the current data science revolution. Recent advances in privacy, fairness, and generalization bounds demonstrate that information theory will also play a pivotal role in the next decade of ML applications: information-theoretic methods can sharpen generalization bounds for deep learning, provide rigorous guarantees for compression of neural networks, promote fairness and privacy in ML training and deployment, and shed light on the limits of learning from noisy data.
We propose a workshop that brings together researchers and practitioners in ML and information theory to encourage knowledge transfer and collaboration between the sister fields. For information theorists, the workshop will highlight novel and socially-critical research directions that promote reliable, responsible, and rigorous development of ML. Moreover, the workshop will expose ICML attendees to emerging information-theoretic tools that may play a critical role in the next decade of ML applications.

"The ICML Workshop on Computational Biology will highlight how machine learning approaches can be tailored to making discoveries with biological data. Practitioners at the intersection of computation, machine learning, and biology are in a unique position to frame problems in biomedicine, from drug discovery to vaccination risk scores, and the Workshop will showcase such recent research. Commodity lab techniques lead to the proliferation of large complex datasets, and require new methods to interpret these collections of high-dimensional biological data, such as genetic sequences, cellular features or protein structures, and imaging datasets. These data can be used to make new predictions towards clinical response, to uncover new biology, or to aid in drug discovery. This workshop aims to bring together interdisciplinary machine learning researchers working at the intersection of machine learning and biology that includes areas such as computational genomics; neuroscience; metabolomics; proteomics; bioinformatics; cheminformatics; pathology; radiology; evolutionary biology; population genomics; phenomics; ecology, cancer biology; causality; representation learning and disentanglement to present recent advances and open questions to the machine learning community.  The workshop is a sequel to the WCB workshops we organized in the last five years at ICML, which had excellent line-ups of talks and were well-received by the community. Every year, we received 60+ submissions. After multiple rounds of rigorous reviewing, around 50 submissions were selected from which the best set of papers were chosen for Contributed talks and Spotlights and the rest were invited for Poster presentations.

"A key challenge for the successful deployment of many real world human-facing automated sequential decision-making systems is the need for human-AI collaboration. Effective collaboration ensures that the complementary abilities and skills of the human-users and the AI system are leveraged to maximize utility. This is for instance important in applications such as autonomous driving, in which a human user’s skill might be required in safety critical situations, or virtual personal assistants, in which a human user can perform real-world physical interactions which the AI system cannot. Facilitating such collaboration requires cooperation, coordination, and communication, e.g., in the form of accountability, teaching interactions, provision of feedback, etc. Without effective human-AI collaboration, the utility of automated sequential decision-making systems can be severely limited. Thus there is a surge of interest in better facilitating human-AI collaboration in academia and industry. Most existing research has focussed only on basic approaches for human-AI collaboration with little focus on long-term interactions and the breadth needed for next-generation applications. In this workshop we bring together researchers to advance this important topic, focussing on the following three directions: (a) Accountability and trust; (b) Adaptive behavior for long-term collaboration; (c) Robust collaboration under mismatch.

"Optimization lies at the heart of many exciting developments in machine learning, statistics and signal processing. As models become more complex and datasets get larger, finding efficient, reliable and provable methods is one of the primary goals in these fields.In the last few decades, much effort has been devoted to the development of first-order methods. These methods enjoy a low per-iteration cost and have optimal complexity, are easy to implement, and have proven to be effective for most machine learning applications. First-order methods, however, have significant limitations: (1) they require fine hyper-parameter tuning, (2) they do not incorporate curvature information, and thus are sensitive to ill-conditioning, and (3) they are often unable to fully exploit the power of distributed computing architectures.Higher-order methods, such as Newton, quasi-Newton and adaptive gradient descent methods, are extensively used in many scientific and engineering domains. At least in theory, these methods possess several nice features: they exploit local curvature information to mitigate the effects of ill-conditioning, they avoid or diminish the need for hyper-parameter tuning, and they have enough concurrency to take advantage of distributed computing environments. Researchers have even developed stochastic versions of higher-order methods, that feature speed and scalability by incorporating curvature information in an economical and judicious manner. However, often higher-order methods are “undervalued.”This workshop will attempt to shed light on this statement. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, second-order methods, adaptive gradient descent methods, regularization techniques, as well as techniques based on higher-order derivatives.

"Adversarial machine learning is a new gamut of technologies that aim to study the vulnerabilities of ML approaches and detect malicious behaviors in adversarial settings. The adversarial agents can deceive an ML classifier by significantly altering its response with imperceptible perturbations to the inputs. Although it is not to be alarmist, researchers in machine learning are responsible for preempting attacks and building safeguards, especially when the task is critical for information security and human lives. We need to deepen our understanding of machine learning in adversarial environments. While the negative implications of this nascent technology have been widely discussed, researchers in machine learning are yet to explore their positive opportunities in numerous aspects. The positive impacts of adversarial machine learning are not limited to boost the robustness of ML models but cut across several other domains. Since there are both positive and negative applications of adversarial machine learning, tackling adversarial learning to its use in the right direction requires a framework to embrace the positives. This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from various communities (e.g., machine learning, computer security, data privacy, and ethics) to synthesize promising ideas and research directions and foster and strengthen cross-community collaborations on both theoretical studies and practical applications. Different from the previous workshops on adversarial machine learning, our proposed workshop seeks to explore the prospects besides reducing the unintended risks for sophisticated ML models.This is a one-day workshop, planned with a 10-minute opening, 11 invited keynotes, about 9 contributed talks, 2 poster sessions, and 2 special sessions for panel discussion about the prospects and perils of adversarial machine learning.The workshop is kindly sponsored by RealAI Inc. and Bosch.

"Visit https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/dfuq21/ for details!While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in recent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making. Deploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating and communicating the uncertainty of predictions. A recent line of work we call distribution-free predictive inference (i.e., conformal prediction and related methods) has developed a set of methods that give finite-sample statistical guarantees for any (possibly incorrectly specified) predictive model and any (unknown) underlying distribution of the data, ensuring reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) for many prediction tasks. This line of work represents a promising new approach to UQ with complex prediction systems but is relatively unknown in the applied machine learning community. Moreover, much remains to be done integrating distribution-free methods with existing approaches to UQ via calibration (e.g. with temperature scaling) -- little work has been done to bridge these two worlds. To facilitate the emerging topics on distribution-free methods, the proposed workshop has two goals. First, to bring together researchers in distribution-free methods with researchers specializing in calibration techniques to catalyze work at this interface. Second, to introduce distribution-free methods to a wider ML audience.

"There has been growing interest in ensuring that deep learning systems are robust and reliable.  Challenges arise when models receive samples drawn from outside the training distribution. For example, a neural network tasked with classifying handwritten digits may assign high confidence predictions to cat images. Anomalies are frequently encountered when deploying ML models in the real world. Well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates are indispensable for many machine learning applications, such as self-driving vehicles and medical diagnosis systems. Generalization to unseen and worst-case inputs is also essential for robustness to distributional shift. In order to have ML models safely deployed in open environments, we must deepen technical understanding in the following areas: (1) Learning algorithms that can detect changes in data distribution (e.g. out-of-distribution examples) and improve out-of-distribution generalization (e.g. temporal, geographical, hardware, adversarial shifts);(2) Mechanisms to estimate and calibrate confidence produced by neural networks in typical and unforeseen scenarios; (3) Guide learning towards an understanding of the underlying causal mechanisms that can guarantee robustness with respect to distribution shift.In order to achieve these goals, it is critical to dedicate substantial effort on(4) Creating benchmark datasets and protocols for evaluating model performance under distribution shift(5) Studying key applications of robust and uncertainty-aware deep learning (e.g., computer vision, robotics, self-driving vehicles, medical imaging), as well as broader machine learning tasks.This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from the machine learning communities to foster future collaborations.

"The Disinformation Countermeasures and Machine Learning (DisCoML) workshop at ICML 2022 in Baltimore will address machine learning techniques to counter disinformation. Today, disinformation is an important challenge that all governments and their citizens face, affecting politics, public health, financial markets, and elections. Specific examples such as lynchings catalyzed by disinformation spread over social media highlight that the threat it poses crosses social scales and boundaries. This threat even extends into the realm of military combat, as a recent NATO StratCom experiment highlighted. Machine learning plays a central role in the production and propagation of dissemination. Bad actors scale disinformation operations by using ML-enabled bots, deepfakes, cloned websites, and forgeries. The situation is exacerbated by proprietary algorithms of search engines and social media platforms, driven by advertising models, that can effectively isolate internet users from alternative information and viewpoints. In fact, social media's business model, with its behavioral tracking algorithms, is arguably optimized for launching a global pandemic of cognitive hacking. Machine learning is also essential for identifying and inhibiting the spread of disinformation at internet speed and scale, but DisCoML welcomes approaches that contribute to countering disinformation in a broad sense. While the ""cybersecurity paradox""–i.e. increased technology spending has not equated to an improved security posture–also applies to disinformation and indicates the need to address human behavior, there is an arms race quality to both problems.

However, real-world applications involve nonstationarities and feedback loops that must be taken into account to measure and mitigate fairness in the long-term. These feedback loops involve the learning process which may be biased because of insufficient exploration, or changes in the environment's dynamics due to strategic responses of the various stakeholders. From a machine learning perspective, these sequential processes are primarily studied through counterfactual analysis and reinforcement learning.The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers from both industry and academia working on the full spectrum of responsible decision-making in dynamic environments, from theory to practice. In particular, we encourage submissions on the following topics: fairness, privacy and security, robustness, conservative and safe algorithms, explainability and interpretability.

"The ICML Expressive Vocalizations (ExVo) Workshop and Competition 2022 introduces, for the first time in a competition setting, the machine learning problem of understanding and generating vocal bursts – a wide range of emotional non-linguistic utterances. Participants of ExVo are presented with three tasks that utilize a single dataset. The dataset and three tasks draw attention to new innovations in emotion science and capture 10 dimensions of emotion reliably perceived in distinct vocal bursts: Awe, Excitement, Amusement, Awkwardness, Fear, Horror, Distress, Triumph, Sadness and Surprise. Of particular interest to the ICML community, these tasks highlight the need for advanced machine learning techniques for multi-task learning, audio generation, and personalized few-shot learning of nonverbal expressive style.With studies of vocal emotional expression often relying on significantly smaller datasets insufficient to apply the latest machine learning innovations, the ExVo competition and workshop provides an unprecedented platform for the development and discussion of novel strategies for understanding vocal bursts and will enable unique forms of collaborations by leading researchers from diverse disciplines. Organized by leading researchers in emotion science and machine learning, the following three tasks are proposed: the Multi-task High-Dimensional Emotion, Age & Country Task (ExVo Multi-Task); the Generative Emotional Vocal Burst Task (ExVo Generate); and the Few-Shot Emotion Recognition task (ExVo Few-Shot).Important dates (AoE)- Challenge Opening (data available): April 1, 2022.- Baselines and paper released: April 8, 2022.- ExVo MultiTask submission deadline: May 12, 2022.- ExVo Few-Shot (test-labels): May 13, 2022.- Workshop paper submission: ~~May 20, 2022~~ Extended June 6 2022.For those interested in submitting research to the ExVo workshop outside of the competition, we encourage contributions covering the following topics: - Detecting and Understanding Vocal Emotional Behavior- Multi-Task Learning in Affective Computing- Generating Nonverbal Vocalizations or Speech Prosody- Personalized Machine Learning for Affective Computing- Other topics related to Affective Verbal and Nonverbal Vocalization

"Adversarial machine learning (AdvML), which aims at tricking ML models by providing deceptive inputs, has been identified as a powerful method to improve various trustworthiness metrics  (e.g.,  adversarial robustness, explainability,  and fairness)  and to advance versatile  ML  paradigms  (e.g.,  supervised and self-supervised learning,  and static and continual learning). As a consequence of the proliferation of AdvML-inspired research works,  the proposed workshop–New Frontiers in AdvML–aims to identify the challenges and limitations of current AdvML methods and explore new prospective and constructive views of AdvML across the full theory/algorithm/application stack. The workshop will explore the new frontiers of AdvML from the following new perspectives: (1) advances in foundational AdvML research, (2) principles and practice of scalable AdvML, and (3) AdvML for good. This will be a full-day workshop, which accepts full paper submissions  (up to 6 pages)  as well as “blue sky” extended abstract submissions (up to 2 pages).

"The past five years have seen rapid progress in large-scale pre-trained models across a variety of domains, such as computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, bioinformatics, etc. Leveraging a huge number of parameters, large-scale pre-trained models are capable of encoding rich knowledge from labeled and/or unlabeled examples. Supervised and self-supervised pre-training have been the two most representative paradigms, through which pre-trained models have demonstrated large benefits on a wide spectrum of downstream tasks. There are also other pre-training paradigms, e.g., meta-learning for few-shot learning, where pre-trained models are trained so that they quickly adapt to solve new tasks. However, there are still many remaining challenges and new opportunities ahead for pre-training, In this workshop, we propose to have the following two foci: (1) Which pre-training methods transfer across different applications/domains, which ones don't, and why? (2) In what settings should we expect pre-training to be effective, compared to learning from scratch?

"Following a series of crippling cyber-attacks that targeted major of the public and social sectors — including schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, and private businesses — the global community has increased its attention on the wider societal impacts of major cyber security events, forming task forces like the UN Open Ended Working Group on Cyber Security and undertaking policy efforts to mitigate these impacts. These actions are important, but policy changes only represent one side of the solution. On the other are technical developments, within which machine learning has been proposed as a key component of future of cyber defense tools, requiring rapid development to provide the speed and scale needed to detect and respond to new and emerging cyber security threats. Cybersecurity is inherently a systems problem and piece-wise application of off-the-shelf ML tools leave critical gaps in both sophistication and interpretable context needed for comprehensive security systems. To successfully develop ML-based cybersecurity defenses, a greater degree of cross-pollination across the ML and cybersecurity communities is needed because both are highly specialized technical domains. Moreover, the requisite ML topics needed to successfully leverage ML for cybersecurity — such as time series analytics, game theory, deep learning, reinforcement learning, representation learning, semi-supervised and self-supervised learning, learning on large scale streaming data, interpretable and robust autonomous systems, etc. - are foundational to the ICML community.The primary aim of this workshop is to build a mutual comprehensive awareness of the problem and solution spaces across the greater ML community and the Cybersecurity/ML for Cybersecurity communities. To provide meaningful engagement, workshop organizers will curate a program which defines the interdisciplinary boundary and opportunities between machine learning and cybersecurity.

"While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in recent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making. Deploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating and communicating the uncertainty of predictions. A recent line of work we call distribution-free predictive inference (i.e., conformal prediction and related methods) has developed a set of methods that give finite-sample statistical guarantees for any (possibly incorrectly specified) predictive model and any (unknown) underlying distribution of the data, ensuring reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) for many prediction tasks. This line of work represents a promising new approach to UQ with complex prediction systems but is relatively unknown in the applied machine learning community. Moreover, much remains to be done integrating distribution-free methods with existing approaches to modern machine learning in computer vision, natural language, reinforcement learning, and so on -- little work has been done to bridge these two worlds. To facilitate the emerging topics on distribution-free methods, the proposed workshop has two goals. First, to bring together researchers in distribution-free methods with researchers specializing in applications of machine learning to catalyze work at this interface. Second, to bring together the existing community of distribution-free uncertainty quantification research, as no other workshop like this exists at a major conference. Given the important recent emphasis on the reliable real-world performance of ML models, we believe a large fraction of ICML attendees will find this workshop highly relevant.

"Machine learning models often break when deployed in the wild, despite excellent performance on benchmarks. In particular, models can learn to rely on apparently unnatural or irrelevant features. For instance, 1) in detecting lung disease from chest X-rays, models rely on the type of scanner rather than physiological signals, 2) in natural language inference, models rely on the number of shared words rather than the subject’s relationship with the object, 3) in precision medicine, polygenic risk scores for diseases like breast cancer rely on genes prevalent mainly in European populations, and predict poorly in other populations. In examples like these and others, the undesirable behavior stems from the model exploiting a spurious correlation. Improper treatment of spurious correlations can discourage the use of ML in the real world and lead to catastrophic consequences in extreme cases. The recent surge of interest in this issue is accordingly welcome and timely: more than 50 closely related papers have been published just in ICML 2021, NeurIPS 2021, and ICLR 2022. However, the most fundamental questions remain unanswered— e.g., how should the notion of spurious correlations be made precise? How should one evaluate models in the presence of spurious correlations? In which situations can a given method be expected to work, or fail? Which notions of invariance are fruitful and tractable? Further, relevant work has sprung up ad hoc from several distinct communities, with limited interplay between them: invariance and independence-constrained learning in causality-inspired ML, methods to decorrelate predictions and protected features (e.g. race) in algorithmic fairness, and stress testing procedures to discover unexpected model dependencies in reliable ML. This workshop will bring together these different communities to make progress on common foundational problems, and facilitate their interaction with domain-experts to build impactful collaborations.

"To reach top-tier performance, deep learning models usually require a large number of parameters and operations, using considerable power and memory. Several methods have been proposed to tackle this problem by leveraging quantization of parameters, pruning, clustering of parameters, decompositions of convolutions, or using distillation. However, most of these works focus mainly on improving efficiency at inference time, disregarding the training cost. In practice, however, most of the energy footprint of deep learning results from training. Hence, this workshop focuses on reducing the training complexity of deep neural networks. Our aim is to encourage submissions specifically concerning the reduction in energy, time, or memory usage at training time. Topics of interest include but are not limited to: (i) compression methods for memory and complexity reduction during training, (ii) energy-efficient hardware architectures, (iii) energy-efficient training algorithms, (iv) novel energy models or energy efficiency training benchmarks, (v) practical applications of low-energy training.

"The goal of reinforcement learning (RL) is to maximize a reward signal by taking optimal decisions. An RL system typically contains several moving components, possibly including a policy, a value function, and a model of the environment. We refer to decision awareness as the notion that each of the components and their combination should be explicitly trained to help the agent improve the total amount of collected reward. To better understand decision awareness, consider as an example a model-based method. For environments with rich observations (e.g., pixel-based), the world model is complex and standard approaches would need a large number of samples and a high-capacity function approximator to learn a reasonable approximation of the dynamics. However, a decision-aware agent might recognize that modeling all the granular complexity of the environment is neither feasible nor necessary to learn an optimal policy and instead focus on modeling aspects that are important for decision making. Decision awareness goes beyond the model learning aspect. In actor-critic algorithms, a critic is trained to predict the expected return while later used to aid policy learning. Is return prediction an optimal strategy for critic learning? And, in general, what is the best way to learn each component of an RL system? Our workshop aims at answering these questions and articulating that decision awareness might be a key towards solving grand challenges in RL, including exploration and sample efficiency. The workshop is about decision-aware RL algorithms, their implications, and real-world applications; we focus on decision-aware objectives, end-to-end procedures, and meta-learning techniques for training and discovering components in modular RL systems, as well as theoretical or empirical analyses of the interaction among multiple modules used by RL algorithms.

"Machine learning advances are used in self-driving cars, speech recognition systems, and translation software. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgency of translating such advances to the domain of biomedicine. Such a pivot requires new machine learning methods to build long-term vaccines and therapeutic strategies, predict immune avoidance, and better repurpose small molecules as drugs.The ICML Workshop on Computational Biology (WCB) will highlight how machine learning approaches can be tailored to making both translational and basic scientific discoveries with biological data. Practitioners at the intersection of computation, machine learning, and biology are in a unique position to frame problems in biomedicine, from drug discovery to vaccination risk scores, and WCB will showcase such recent research. Commodity lab techniques lead to the proliferation of large complex datasets and require new methods to interpret these collections of high-dimensional biological data, such as genetic sequences, cellular features or protein structures and imaging datasets. These data can be used to make new predictions towards clinical response, uncover new biology, or aid in drug discovery.This workshop aims to bring together interdisciplinary machine learning researchers working in areas such as computational genomics; neuroscience; metabolomics; proteomics; bioinformatics; cheminformatics; pathology; radiology; evolutionary biology; population genomics; phenomics; ecology, cancer biology; causality; representation learning and disentanglement to present recent advances and open questions to the machine learning community.

"The importance of robust predictions continues to grow as machine learning models are increasingly relied upon in high-stakes settings. Ensuring reliability in real-world applications remains an enormous challenge, particularly because data in the wild frequently differs substantially from the data on which models were trained. This phenomenon, broadly known as “distribution shift”, has become a major recent focus of the research community.With the growing interest in addressing this problem has come growing awareness of the multitude of possible meanings of “distribution shift” and the importance of understanding the distinctions between them: which types of shift occur in the real world, and under which of these is generalization feasible? Negative results seem just as common as positive ones; where provable generalization is possible, it often depends on strong structural assumptions whose likelihood of holding in reality is questionable. Existing approaches often lack rigor and clarity with regards to the precise problem they are trying to solve. Some work has been done to precisely define distribution shift and to produce benchmarks which properly reflect real-world distribution shift, but overall there seems to be little communication between the communities tackling foundations and applications respectively. Recent strides have been made to move beyond tinkering, bringing much needed rigor to the field, and we hope to encourage this effort by opening a dialogue to share ideas between these communities.

"Deep vision models are prone to short-cut learning, vulnerable to adversarial attacks, as well as natural and synthetic image corruptions.

Since performance on clean ImageNet clearly tests IID but not OOD generalization, this calls for new challenging OOD datasets testing different aspects of generalization.Our goal is to bring the robustness, domain adaptation, and out-of-distribution detection communities together to work on a new broad-scale benchmark that tests diverse aspects of current computer vision models and guides the way towards the next generation of models.

"Many of the world's most pressing issues, such as climate change, pandemics, financial market stability and fake news, are emergent phenomena that result from the interaction between a large number of strategic or learning agents. Understanding these systems is thus a crucial frontier for scientific and technology development that has the potential to permanently improve the safety and living standards of humanity. Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) (also known as individual-based modelling) is an approach toward creating simulations of these types of complex systems by explicitly modelling the actions and interactions of the individual agents contained within. However, current methodologies for calibrating and validating ABMs rely on human expert domain knowledge and hand-coded behaviours for individual agents and environment dynamics. Recent progress in AI has the potential to offer exciting new approaches to learning, calibrating, validation, analysing and accelerating ABMs. This interdisciplinary workshop is meant to bring together practitioners and theorists to boost ABM method development in AI, and stimulate novel applications across disciplinary boundaries - making ICML the ideal venue.Our inaugural workshop will be organised along two axes. First, we seek to provide a venue where ABM researchers from a variety of domains can introduce AI researchers to their respective domain problems. To this end, we are inviting a number of high-profile speakers across various application domains. Second, we seek to stimulate research into AI methods that can scale to large-scale agent-based models with the potential to redefine our capabilities of creating, calibrating, and validating such models.

"In modern ML domains, state-of-the-art performance is attained by highly overparameterized models that are expensive to train, costing weeks of time and millions of dollars. At the same time, after deploying the model, the learner may realize issues such as leakage of private data or vulnerability to adversarial examples. The learner may also wish to impose additional constraints post-deployment, for example, to ensure fairness for different subgroups. Retraining the model from scratch to incorporate additional desiderata would be expensive. As a consequence, one would instead prefer to update the model, which can yield significant savings of resources such as time, computation, and memory over retraining from scratch. Some instances of this principle in action include the emerging field of machine unlearning, and the celebrated paradigm of fine-tuning pretrained models. The goal of our workshop is to provide a platform to stimulate discussion about both the state-of-the-art in updatable ML and future challenges in the field.

"In just the past couple of years, we have seen significant advances in the capabilities of (Large) Language Models. One of the most striking capabilities of these systems is knowledge retrieval — Language Models can answer a diverse set of questions, which differ substantially in the domain knowledge needed for their responses, and their input structure. The precise methods for knowledge retrieval vary from the language model directly generating a response (parametric approaches) to a combination of generation and referencing an external knowledge corpus, e.g. retrieval augmented generation, to primarily using an external knowledge corpus with language model embeddings (semi-parametric approaches.) Despite the rapid advances, there remain many pressing open questions on the limits of knowledge retrieval with language models, and connections between these different approaches. How factual are generated responses, and how does this vary with question complexity, model scale, and importantly, different methods of knowledge retrieval? How important is the role of (self-supervised/supervised) pretraining?  What are the tradeoffs between few-shot (prompt based) approaches and finetuning when adapting to novel domains? And relatedly, to what extent do different knowledge retrieval approaches generalize to unseen settings?
